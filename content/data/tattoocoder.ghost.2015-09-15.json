Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`.

Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)","html":"<p>You're live! Nice.

Although it is very mature with many options, the community was pressuring for a .NET option and now it is available.\n\nModeled much like a standard Web API / MVC project at first glance, there may be a few things that you like to take advantage of in these types of projects that throw you for a loop when using the new .NET option. These include Dependency Injection, Entity Framework (Migrations and Relationships), and the help page.\n\n### Getting Started\nYou have two options for getting a project started.\n\n1\\. Go to the Azure Portal and create a new Azure Mobile Service and download the project\n([http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-dotnet-get-started/](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-dotnet-get-started/))\n\n2\\. Start New Project from Visual Studio 2013 SP2 and choose \"Web\" -&gt; \"Windows Azure Mobile Service\"\n\nFor this example, I went with option #1 and called it \"_mytodotips_\". Download the solution and be sure to build it to get all of the necessary nuget packages and ensure that your environment is set.\n\n### Entity Framework, Code First, Migrations, and Relationship Challenges\nThere are a few items here that may leave you scratching your head here, frustrating you, and depending on your temper perhaps throwing things. So, let me see if I can keep your mouse in one piece.\n\n#### Migrations\nDo this first! Open Package Manager Console, Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console, and type the following command> enable-migrations\nthe result will create a new folder in your solution called \"Migrations\" containing a file named \"Configuration.cs\", thus enabling code first migrations when your schema changes. In order to complete the change, open the WebApiConfig.cs file in the \"App_Start\" folder.\n\nComment out the _Database.SetInitializer(...);_ line, and you may also comment out or delete the class that is called within the method. &nbsp;This method drops and recreates the database each time the application is run.\n\nInsert the following code above the _SetInitializer(...);_&nbsp;line to call the Configurator class just created by \"enable-migrations\" and&nbsp;explicitly apply the latest migration unless it has already been applied.\n\n```language-csharp\nvar migrator = new DbMigrator(new Configuration());\nmigrator.Update();\n```\n\nThe following namespaces will also need to be added to your imports:\n\n```language-csharp\nusing System.Data.Entity.Migrations;\nusing mytodotipsService.Migrations;\n```\n\nOpen Package Manager Console and run _add-migration init_, in doing so sets the initial migration and establishes the migration table.\n\nNow whenever you add to your models, you can run the same _Add-Migration \"migration name\"_&nbsp;in the Package Manager Console and then hit F5 to update the local machine database or publish to Azure and run the service to update the Azure SQL Server database.\n\n#### Relationships\nRelationships are pretty easy, however there are a few maintenance items in the **OnModelCreating **method I have found that help me get past some errors when running \"update-database\" or \"add-migration\".\n\nEach class in Azure Mobile Services that has a table behind inherits from _EntityData_&nbsp;which implements _ITableData. _When make FK relationships you may receive errors when indexes are being created/altered. I have found by setting the Id field to be the PK on the table that sometimes these can be alleviated.\n\n```language-csharp\nmodelBuilder.Properties<string>()\n\t.Where(p => p.Name == \"Id\")\n\t.Configure(p => p.IsKey());\n```\n\nAnother option I also put on all new model classes is the following, this tells the database that the Id field is auto generated and is not required to be set when creating a new class.\n\n```language-csharp\nmodelBuilder.Entity<entityname>()\n\t.Property(m => m.Id)\n\t.HasDatabaseGeneratedOption(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity);\n```\n\nNow this a simply a personal preference that I'm sure many will disagree with, but I happen to like my tables to be singular.\n\n```language-csharp\nmodelBuilder.Conventions.Remove<PluralizingTableNameConvention>();\n```\n\n### Dependency Injection\nMy favorite DI engine for sometime has been AutoFac, and by accident I discovered its baked into Azure Mobile's .NET back end as well.\n\nNow that I have the Entity Framework Code First context all set the way I like, I can now make sure I don't have to new up in every controller.\n\nIn our WebApiConfig.cs class, there is a `ServiceConfig.Initialize(...)` call to kick off the configuration process of the application. It accepts a ConfigBuilder class accepting options for your service, but also has an overload to accept a Func to register your own dependencies which happens to be an autofac container.\n\nHere is how to add the database context, for example, using AutoFac.\n\n```language-csharp\nHttpConfiguration config = ServiceConfig.Initialize(\n\tnew ConfigBuilder(options, (configuration, builder) =>  \n    {        \n    \tmytodotipsContext context = new mytodotipsContext();\n        builder.RegisterInstance(context).As<mytodotipscontext>().SingleInstance();  }));\n```\n\nAnd now in our ToDoItemController.cs we can add a constructor and alter the Initializer method to the following.\n\n```language-csharp\npublic class TodoItemController : TableController<todoitem>\n{ \n\tmytodotipsContext context; \n    public TodoItemController(mytodotipsContext myContext) \n    {  \n    \tthis.context = myContext; \n    } \n    \n    protected override void Initialize(HttpControllerContext controllerContext) \n    {  \n    \tbase.Initialize(controllerContext);    \n        // mytodotipsContext context = new mytodotipsContext();  \n        DomainManager = new EntityDomainManager<todoitem>(context, Request, Services); \t\t\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Help Page\nSo, you've got Entity Framework setup with relationships, Dependency Injection going with AutoFac and now you are checking out the help page and getting nothing. What happened?\n\nThere are a few issues we want to attack here.\n\n*   Where is the data model?\n*   I only want to show JSON\n*   and a few more as we fix the top 2Data Model MissingThis is a common issue with serializers when there are circular properties.  In this case there is a Profile class that has ToDo items that has a Profile property.  See the Code First Mapping here:\n\n```language-csharp\nmodelBuilder.Entity<todoitems>().HasRequired(t => t.Profile)                \n\t.WithMany(p => p.ToDoItems)                \n    .HasForeignKey(t => t.ProfileId);\n```\n\nWhat happens here is when the JsonSerializer and XmlSerlizer &nbsp;starts to walk the property tree; they get in an infinite loop and eventually exhaust the maximum errors and exit. In order to fix this, we will add the following to the WebApiConfig.cs class inside the Register method. _*note only adding this for JsonFormatters, but can be handled for Xml just as well._\n\n```language-csharp\nconfig.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SerializerSettings.ReferenceLoopHandling = ReferenceLoopHandling.Ignore;\n```\nNow we can F5, see the help page and the object model represented in Json but the application/xml and text/xml boxes still show with the error. &nbsp;As mentioned in our to do list above we only wanted to support Json. To do so, add the following to the configuration now.\n\n```language-csharp\n// Remove default XML handler\nvar matches = config.Formatters     \n\t.Where(f => f.SupportedMediaTypes         \n    .Where(m => m.MediaType.ToString() == \"application/xml\" ||\n    \tm.MediaType.ToString() == \"text/xml\")         \n        .Count() > 0)     \n        .ToList();\n\nforeach (var match in matches) \n\tconfig.Formatters.Remove(match);\n```\n\nAnd finally, I like to properly case Json.\n\n```language-csharp\nconfig.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SerializerSettings.ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver();\n```\n\nThis single line will make JavaScript devs happy. Instead of seeing the objects like this:\n\n```language-javascript\n[    {        \"Text\": \"sample string 1\",        \"Complete\": true,        \"Id\": \"sample string 3\",        \"__version\": \"QEBA\",        \"__createdAt\": \"2014-06-02T16:40:40.641Z\",        \"__updatedAt\": \"2014-06-02T16:40:40.641Z\",        \"__deleted\": true    },\n```\n\nthey are cased properly like this:\n\n```language-javascript\n[    {        \"text\": \"sample string 1\",        \"complete\": true,        \"id\": \"sample string 3\",        \"__version\": \"QEBA\",        \"__createdAt\": \"2014-06-02T16:40:40.641Z\",        \"__updatedAt\": \"2014-06-02T16:40:40.641Z\",        \"__deleted\": true    }\n```\n\nThere are other features such as Notification Hubs and Scheduled Jobs which are awesome additions to any application. Be sure to check these out when leveraging Azure Mobile Services, regardless of whether you are using .NET or JavaScript as your back end of choice.\n\nLeave a comment if you have a tip or trick you like to use or pass on as well.","html":"<p>I've been working with Azure Mobile Services since it was released and until recently only the JavaScript backend was available, built using node.js.

Why do you build apps for that platform? You should be learning Java and Objective C and putting your apps on iOS and Android; that's where the users are.\n\nThat is the message from the media, family, tech pundits and co-workers. And the numbers say that as well; the latest report shows that Android holds a ridiculous global market share of 80%, Apple with 12% and Windows Phone at 4% respectively. &nbsp;So why should I build an app for Windows Phone first?\n\nIts about visibility.\n\n### Visibility\nApple has more than 1 million apps on the iOS platform and Android just over 800,000\\. It is virtually impossible without spending an enormous amount of time, money and or energy getting an app exposure to the user base. &nbsp;However, through programs like Nokia's [DVLUP](http://dvlup.com/)&nbsp;you can manage to get very visibility in the marketplace, increased reviews and downloads and through the combination of all of these. Revenue will begin to climb. Now, there is some learning to be done by the developer when it comes to monetizing your app; I won't go into the various strategies as there have been many workshops/articles/blogs published so definitely look into those.\n\n### Building a Brand / Marketing\nBuild it and they will come is not a marketing campaign strategy! I'm pretty involved in the community and talk with a lot of developers, read quite a few email and message board threads about how they have a new app for this or that...please review, download etc. &nbsp;But that is the last place I see it ever mentioned.\n\nHere are a few suggestions:\n\n*   Build a Facebook Fan Page - it's free\n*   [Azure Websites](http://www.windowsazure.com/) - every subscriber gets 10 free site, build one for your app\n*   Blog about the technology you used in your app, why you chose to do it.&nbsp;\n*   Contact Media outlets about your app - [wpcentral.com](http://wpcentral.com/), [wmpoweruser.com](http://wmpoweruser.com/)\n*   Use social media to your advantage - twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, Instagram (yes) &amp; learn what a hashtag (#) is and use those to your advantage. If you don't know ask a teenager.\n\n### Design\nNow none of the above will matter if your app is a battleship grey page with black comic sans font. Spend some time on design.  Now I know, not all developers are good designers. Guess what? Not all designers are good developers.  Find a friend who knows Photoshop, team up! There is this really cool online collaboration tool - Team Foundation Service that's free for up to 5 users, collaborate on a project and make it happen.\n\n### Build with Other Platforms in Mind - Xamarin\nNow that you have a great idea, either put together a great design or found a friend &amp; have a marketing strategy. &nbsp;Build your app with the correct tools and architecture so when you have Android and iOS users wanting it, you can respond in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n[Xamarin ](http://xamarin.com/)and Microsoft have teamed up to bring a closer integration in Visual Studio 2013 to allow you to create **native **iOS and Android applications (not HTML5 &amp; JavaScript) using C# and Portable Class Libraries. Thus maximizing your code reuse. \n\nMicrosoft also just announce full [Azure Mobile Services support for Xamarin](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2013/11/21/windows-azure-general-availability-release-of-biztalk-services-traffic-manager-azure-ad-app-access-xamarin-support-for-mobile-services.aspx).\n\nI will be blogging more examples, in the meantime visit [www.xamarin.com](http://www.xamarin.com/) and follow&nbsp;[@xamarinhq](http://www.twitter.com/xamarinhq) &amp; [@jamesmontemagno](http://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno)&nbsp;(Xamarin Developer Evangelist) on twitter.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me via twitter&nbsp;[@spboyer](http://www.twitter.com/spboyer) concerning xamarin, portable class libraries, windows phone development, windows 8 development or anything.","html":"<h3 id=\"whywindowsphone\">Why Windows Phone?</h3>\n\n<p>This is not a new question, but a question or topic that I get involved a lot. &nbsp;Why do you have a Windows Phone?

If you don't know ask a teenager.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\n\n<p>Now none of the above will matter if your app is a battleship grey page with black comic sans font. Spend some time on design.  Now I know, not all developers are good designers. Guess what? Not all designers are good developers.  Find a friend who knows Photoshop, team up! There is this really cool online collaboration tool - Team Foundation Service that's free for up to 5 users, collaborate on a project and make it happen.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buildwithotherplatformsinmindxamarin\">Build with Other Platforms in Mind - Xamarin</h3>\n\n<p>Now that you have a great idea, either put together a great design or found a friend &amp; have a marketing strategy. &nbsp;Build your app with the correct tools and architecture so when you have Android and iOS users wanting it, you can respond in a reasonable amount of time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://xamarin.com/\">Xamarin </a>and Microsoft have teamed up to bring a closer integration in Visual Studio 2013 to allow you to create <em>*native *</em>iOS and Android applications (not HTML5 &amp; JavaScript) using C# and Portable Class Libraries.

If you are not familiar with PCL's see my \"[Move Your ViewModels](http://blog.tattoocoder.com/2013/01/portable-mvvm-light-move-your-view.html)\" series.\n\nThere is a caveat however when using Azure Mobile Services in your PCL; although all of the data calls to the services are available, using the [Identity ](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-users-wp8/)feature is not and must be implemented in a platform specific way.\n\nThe Identity feature allows your application to leverage the user's Microsoft, Google, Facebook or Twitter account to login to the application and abstract the overhead of OAuth or provider specific authentication models into a single call.\n\n> var user =&nbsp;MobileService.LoginAsync(MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Twitter);\n\n### The Challenge - Maximize Code Reuse\nThere is no secret that Model-View-View-Model (MVVM) is a preferred pattern for xaml developers, but it is also know that sometimes breaking patterns is needed either due to time constraints or other restrictions.\n\nIn the effort to maintain the MVVM pattern in this scenario a platform abstraction is needed to accomplish to goal of reusing as much code as possible. &nbsp;[Matt Hidinger](http://www.twitter.com/matthidinger) did a [great talk at BUILD 2013](http://www.matthidinger.com/archive/2013/07/02/video-and-code-from-my-build-talk-on-sharing-code.aspx) this year on this topic, give a watch on his [blog](http://www.matthidinger.com/archive/2013/07/02/video-and-code-from-my-build-talk-on-sharing-code.aspx).\n\n### Scenario - Setting up your solution\nI won't walk through setting up a Mobile Service on Azure, [see this post for instructions](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/), so let's assume we have a Windows Phone &amp; Windows Store application where we'd like to share code in a Portable Class Library and allow the user to login with their Twitter account. The project solution should contain 3 projects:\n\n[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jazrb31Bp-o/Uf_dd2K-F0I/AAAAAAAAAiI/yux5KOb6WX8/s320/Solution.PNG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jazrb31Bp-o/Uf_dd2K-F0I/AAAAAAAAAiI/yux5KOb6WX8/s1600/Solution.PNG)*   PortableAzure.Win8 - Windows 8 Blank &nbsp;Application\n*   PortableAzure.Phone8 - Windows Phone 8 Application\n*   PortableAzure.Core - Portable Class Library Project\nI have added the following nuget packages to the projects\n\n*   Microsoft.Net.Http\n*   Portable.MvvmLightLibs\n*   WindowsAzure.MobileServices\nThere is some plumbing related to the MVVM structure that is needed as well. &nbsp;Get the \"before\" code here&nbsp;[http://sdrv.ms/14ufYYZ](http://sdrv.ms/14ufYYZ)&nbsp;, your solution explorer should look like the image here -&gt;.\n\n### Adding Azure&nbsp;\n\n_Assumption(s) - you have created a Azure Mobile Service._\n\nFirst, you will want to add a new class to the **Services **folder in the **PortableAzure.Core** project and call it AzureMobileServices. I have also added an empty interface out of habit and to use for IoC (Inversion of Control).\n\n> namespace PortableAzure.Core.Services\n> {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; public class AzureMobileServices : IAzureMobileServices\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public MobileServiceClient MobileService = new MobileServiceClient(\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \"https://portableazure.azure-mobile.net/\",\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \"[your app key]\"\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; );\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public AzureMobileServices()\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; public interface IAzureMobileServices\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> }\nThe app key and url comes from the Azure portal when you complete the setup; you will want to choose \"Connect to an Existing Project\". Either Windows Phone or Windows 8 is an acceptable choice.\n\nNext step is to [setup the Twitter authentication](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/how-to-guides/register-for-twitter-authentication/), or other provider of your choosing. &nbsp;([reference](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-users-wp8/))\n\nNow that that is complete, we'll add the necessary platform specific code to the Windows Phone &amp; Windows 8 platforms to prompt the user to login using their Twitter account.\n\n### Windows Phone\nOpen the App.xaml.cs and create a new property for the AzureMobileService class from the Core project.\n\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; public partial class App : Application\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /// &lt;summary&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /// Provides easy access to the root frame of the Phone Application.\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /// &lt;returns&gt;The root frame of the Phone Application.&lt;/returns&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public static PhoneApplicationFrame RootFrame { get; private set; }&nbsp;> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;** public AzureMobileServices Azure { get; private set; }&nbsp;**> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /// &lt;summary&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /// Constructor for the Application object.\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public App()\nThen in the App constructor create the new instance of the AzureMobileService class.\n\n> Azure = new AzureMobileServices();&nbsp;In order to prompt the user, open the MainPage.xaml.cs file and add the following code to the PhoneApplicationPage_Loaded event.\n\n> &nbsp;private async void PhoneApplicationPage_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MobileServiceUser user = null;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while (user == null)\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; string message;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; try\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; user = await((App)Application.Current).Azure.MobileService.LoginAsync(MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Twitter);\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; message = string.Format(\"You are now logged in - {0}\", user.UserId);\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; catch (InvalidOperationException)\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; message = \"You must log in.

Login Required\";\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **var dialog = new MessageDialog(message);\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dialog.Commands.Add(new UICommand(\"OK\"));\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; await dialog.ShowAsync();**\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n\n### The Good &amp; Bad - so far\nTo this point everything is working great and we have now effectively added the authentication to each platform using the Identity features in Azure Mobile Services. But other than the url and the key of the Azure Mobile Service; there isn't a lot of code reuse in this scenario.\n\nThis is a necessity when there are platform specific implementations of a feature. &nbsp;In this case, the UI needs to present differently and cannot re-use the xaml or controls that are a part of the login utility for the specified provider.\n\nThe bad part of this is it breaks the MVVM pattern to a degree by putting some of the logic in the code behind.\n\nIn the next installment, I'll show how to add an abstraction layer and use the MVVM Light Event Bus to push some of this code back to our view models.\n\nHere is the completed [code for Part 1](http://sdrv.ms/14upB9R).","html":"<p>Azure Mobile Services is undoubtedly one of the best platforms to emerge from the Azure group over the last year.

Choose either the browser (cloud) based IDE or download the Windows app.Once the application is launched select New Project -> Cross Platform Device Application (Kendo UI Mobile). Name the project \"MyBloodPressure\" and click Ok.In doing so, Icenium presents the built in \"Hello World\" type template. Shows how geolocation, transitions, styling using Kendo UI Mobile etc.  If you run the application by either hitting F5 or clicking the \"Run\" icon atop the IDE you'll also see the awesome tools for viewing the various mobile devices currently supported as well.After you spend a few minutes playing with the emulators and realizing how cool that all is, we'll rip out some stuff add some sauce to this and get cooking.\n\n### Reorganizing the Project for Organization\nI'm a very big proponent of being able to look at a project and know what the heck is going without having to hunt down someone or run the code and step through it to find out how it's all composed.  In a C#/XAML world in I use the MVVM pattern with MVVM Light for my projects. I like to see the view folder, viewmodel folder etc. when developing the app.  For doing so here I will leverage RequireJS  for structuring the organization.  \n\n#### Removing&nbsp;unnecessary&nbsp;files\nDelete the hello-world.js from the scripts folder as we will not be using this for the project.\n\n#### Folder structure\nFirst, lets create a few folders.  At the root of the project create an app folder that contains view, viewmodel and model.For any scripts that are 3rd party libraries, I prefer to put those in the scripts folder and any that are related directly to the application specific functionality I organize them within the app folder appropriately.  Given that, I'll move the kendo.mobile.min.js, jquery.min.js and also add require.js to the scripts folderNext, add a new JavaScript file to the app folder by right clicking and selecting add new file. Name is main.js; this will be the entry point to the application.Also add a JavaScript file to the app folder named app.js, this will serve as the singelton for exposing the viewmodels and could also be referred to as the view model locator.First item of business is to tell require.js where to find the modules we either have or will be creating in our application. Add the following to main.js to configure require.js.> require.config({\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; paths: {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jQuery: \"../scripts/jquery.min\",\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; kendo: \"../scripts/kendo.mobile.min\",\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; view: \"../app/view\",\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; viewmodel: \"../app/viewmodel\",\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; app: \"../app\"\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; },\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; shim: {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jQuery: {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exports: \"jQuery\"\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; },\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; kendo: {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deps: [\"jQuery\"],\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exports: \"kendo\"\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> });What this is doing, if you are not familiar, is telling require.js that when a module is defined like> define(['viewmodel/bp'], function(bp) { ... } );it knows to go look for bp.js inside of the \"[root]/app/viewmodel\" folder and not a relative path etc.  In the shim portion of the code we are stating that kendo has a dependency on jQuery and should wait for that library to load first.  For more information on requirejs and the config method see http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config .Finally in the main.js file add the following to create the app module, put it in scope and init the application.> var app;\n> require([\"app/app\"], function (application) {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log('initializing');\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; app = application;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; app.init();\n> });Last order of business is to add the code to app.js to tell kendo to initialize the mobile application.  Here is the full app.js code for now.> define([\"jQuery\", \"kendo\"], function ($, kendo) {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; var _kendoApplication;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; return {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; init: function () {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log('app init');\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _kendoApplication = new kendo.mobile.Application(document.body,\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; { transition: \"slide\", layout: \"mobile-tabstrip\" });\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> }); &nbsp;&nbsp;The init function is called when the application first fires up setting the transitons of the app the 'slide' and telling kendo what the layout root of the app is; in this case 'mobile-tabstrip'.\n\n### Wiring Up Index.html\nNow that the scripts, view, viewmodel, entry points etc. are all setup; open index.html.In the <head> tag remove everything except the references to the .css and cordova.js files and the we need to add the script reference to main and require.js for our entry point.  After that all scripts will be loaded using AMD and require.js . </head>> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;head&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;script src=\"cordova.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;script data-main=\"app/main\" src=\"scripts/require.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;link href=\"kendo/styles/kendo.mobile.all.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" /&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;link href=\"styles/main.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" /&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/head&gt;Also remove the script tag at the bottom of the file that refers to the kendo.mobile.application as we have now moved that to the app.js init function.Finally, remove all <div> tag sections with a data-role of view other that the first one.  These will be separated into individual html files and stored in the views folder in Part 2 of the series.  The final html document should appear as:</div>> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n> &lt;html&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;head&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;script src=\"cordova.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n> &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;link href=\"styles/main.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" /&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/head&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;body&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;div data-role=\"view\" id=\"tabstrip-home\" data-title=\"Hello World!\"&gt;\n> &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;div data-role=\"layout\" data-id=\"mobile-tabstrip\"&gt;\n> &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; kendo: \"../scripts/kendo.mobile.min\",\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; view: \"../app/view\",\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; viewmodel: \"../app/viewmodel\",\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; app: \"../app\"\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; },\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; shim: {\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jQuery: {\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exports: \"jQuery\"\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; },\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; kendo: {\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deps: [\"jQuery\"],\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exports: \"kendo\"\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n  });What this is doing, if you are not familiar, is telling require.js that when a module is defined like> define(['viewmodel/bp'], function(bp) { ... } );it knows to go look for bp.js inside of the \"[root]/app/viewmodel\" folder and not a relative path etc.  In the shim portion of the code we are stating that kendo has a dependency on jQuery and should wait for that library to load first.  For more information on requirejs and the config method see <a href='http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config'>http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config</a> .Finally in the main.js file add the following to create the app module, put it in scope and init the application.> var app;\n  require([\"app/app\"], function (application) {\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log('initializing');\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; app = application;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; app.init();\n  });Last order of business is to add the code to app.js to tell kendo to initialize the mobile application.  Here is the full app.js code for now.> define([\"jQuery\", \"kendo\"], function ($, kendo) {\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; var _kendoApplication;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; return {\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; init: function () {\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log('app init');\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _kendoApplication = new kendo.mobile.Application(document.body,\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; { transition: \"slide\", layout: \"mobile-tabstrip\" });\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n  }); &nbsp;&nbsp;The init function is called when the application first fires up setting the transitons of the app the 'slide' and telling kendo what the layout root of the app is; in this case 'mobile-tabstrip'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"wiringupindexhtml\">Wiring Up Index.html</h3>\n\n<p>Now that the scripts, view, viewmodel, entry points etc. are all setup; open index.html.In the <head> tag remove everything except the references to the .css and cordova.js files and the we need to add the script reference to main and require.js for our entry point.  After that all scripts will be loaded using AMD and require.js . </head>> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;head&gt;  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;script src=\"cordova.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;link href=\"styles/main.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" /&gt;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/head&gt;Also remove the script tag at the bottom of the file that refers to the kendo.mobile.application as we have now moved that to the app.js init function.Finally, remove all <div> tag sections with a data-role of view other that the first one.  These will be separated into individual html files and stored in the views folder in Part 2 of the series.  The final html document should appear as:</div>> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n  &lt;html&gt;\n  &nbsp;

Spread that disease?I know how I feel after taking a good 5 mile run or so and beating a goal or my last time thinking, \"hell yes!\" and that's the same feeling I get when a project is complete or I inspire a developer to do something different or try a new path and then later they tell me \"thanks, just what I needed\".Recently, after a .NET User Group meeting I sat and had a beer with a few friends from the group and we had this very discussion and the conversation was really good.  I heard stuff like...\"It's not their project....\"\"...making the other guy money, why be passionate\"\"...some companies are better at making their devs feel ownership...\"What are your thoughts?  What can make you more enthusiastic or pump up that 9-5'er you know at your office?Start the conversation....</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1359474120002,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1367853544706,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1359474120002,"published_by":1},{"id":17,"uuid":"258aa052-df69-46e2-ac1a-652f074119fc","title":"Portable MVVM Light - Move Your View Models : Part 2","slug":"portable_mvvm_light_move_your_view_models_part_2","markdown":"In the [first part](http://blog.tattoocoder.com/2013/01/portable-mvvm-light-move-your-view.html) I covered how to get the initial project setup and share the ViewModels and ViewModelLocator between a Windows Phone 8 project and a Windows Store Application. &nbsp;In this post, I'll add a DataService and a Model class that will be used to get the most recent posts from the Windows Phone Blog and display the results.\n\n### Adding DataService and Async to Portable Class Library\nThe purpose of the DataService in the context of this project is to retrieve the RSS feed from the Windows Phone Blog ([http://blogs.windows.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/rss.aspx](http://blogs.windows.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/rss.aspx)) using the async methods available in the 4.5 Framework, return a collection of our Headline class object for the UI to handle and display.\n\n#### Headline Class Model\nThe Headline class is the object that will be loaded and a collection of these will be built and returned from the data service method. &nbsp;Create a new folder in the Mvvm.PCL project called \"Model\" and add a new file called Headline.cs.\n\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; public class Headline\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public string Title { get; set; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public string Description { get; set; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public string Url { get; set; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public DateTime Published { get; set; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n\n#### IDataService\nIn good practice, create an interface for the DataService class. &nbsp;This would allow for taking advantage of dependency injection if you chose to do so. Add a new interface file to the model folder called IDataService.cs. &nbsp;Here is the interface:\n\n> namespace Mvvm.PCL.Model\n> {\n>  public interface IDataService\n>  {\n>   void GetHeadlines(Action&lt;List&lt;Headline&gt;, Exception&gt; callback);\n>  }\n> }\nThe interface defines a single method that accepts a delegate with a collections or List&lt;T&gt; of Headline and an Exception parameter.\n\n#### DataService\nNext, in the same folder, add the DataService.cs file and implement the interface.\n\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; public class DataService : IDataService\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public void GetHeadlines(Action&lt;List&lt;Headline&gt;, Exception&gt; callback)\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throw new NotImplementedException();\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n\n#### HttpWebRequest\nMost simple requests for data are done with the [WebClient ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient(v=vs.110).aspx)class, however this class is not available in Portable Class libraries and is really only an abstraction of what must be used and that is the HttpWebRequest.\n\nAdd a new method to the class called MakeAsyncRequest accepting a url (string) as a parameter and set the method to return a Task&lt;string&gt;. Within the method I'll use the Task.Factory.FromAsync method to call the url&nbsp;asynchronously&nbsp;returning the Task&lt;WebRequest&gt; then use a continuation to read the WebResponse.\n\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; private static Task&lt;string&gt; MakeAsyncRequest(string url)\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HttpWebRequest request = WebRequest.CreateHttp(url);\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; request.Method = \"GET\";\n> \n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Task&lt;WebResponse&gt; task = Task.Factory.FromAsync(\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; request.BeginGetResponse,\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (asyncResult) =&gt; request.EndGetResponse(asyncResult),\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (object)null);\n> \n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return task.ContinueWith(t =&gt; ReadStreamFromResponse(t.Result));\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; private static string ReadStreamFromResponse(WebResponse response)\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; using (Stream responseStream = response.GetResponseStream())\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(responseStream))\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; string strContent = sr.ReadToEnd();\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return strContent;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\nThe GetHeadlines method can now be completed. First add the static url.\n\n> &nbsp;private readonly string uri = \"[http://blogs.windows.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/rss.aspx](http://blogs.windows.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/rss.aspx)\";\n\nThen declare a variable to hold the results of the MakeAsyncRequest method and set the call with the await keyword so the UI thread is not blocked.\n\n> var t = **await **MakeAsyncRequest(uri);\nYou will also have to mark the method as async or the compiler will give you an error telling you to do so.\n\n> public **async **void GetHeadlines(Action&lt;List&lt;Headline&gt;, Exception&gt; callback)\n> {\n> ...\n> }\nThe results returned are a string type and there are a couple of options to get it into a nice format to work with. &nbsp;Your first option might be to use the Silverlight [SyndicationFeed ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.syndication.syndicationfeed(v=vs.110).aspx)class which is in the System.ServiceModel.Syndication namespace. However, it is not inherently available in the portable classes and you'll need to go searching for it on your dev machine. **Hint **(_C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Silverlight\\v4.0\\Libraries\\Client\\System.ServiceModel.Syndication.dll_).\n\nI'm choosing to use LINQ and doing Linq to XML here to get what I need out of the results string and inflate my classes and return it.\n\nHere is the completed method.\n\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public async void GetHeadlines(Action&lt;List&lt;Headline&gt;, Exception&gt; callback)\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // locally scoped exception var\n> &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}).ToList();\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; catch (Exception ex)\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // should do some other\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; callback(results, err);\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n\nThat covers all of the code needed in the Portable Class(es) for getting the data, just need to edit the MainViewModel class constructor to create the DataService class, implement the new method and create a Headlines property.\n\nMainViewModel\nAdd a new property for the headlines to be bound to by the UI.\n\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; private List&lt;Model.Headline&gt; _headlines;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public List&lt;Model.Headline&gt; Headlines\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; get { return _headlines; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _headlines = value;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RaisePropertyChanged(() =&gt; Headlines);\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\nIn the constructor, create an instance of the DataService and execute the method. &nbsp;I did mention earlier that there is an IDataService for DI, but for this example an concrete DataService class is created.\n\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public MainViewModel()\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /// create a new dataservice class\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; service.GetHeadlines((headlines, err) =&gt; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (err != null)\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /// if there is an error should create a property and bind to it for better practices\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(err.ToString());\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Grid x:Name=\"ContentPanel\" Grid.Row=\"1\" Margin=\"12,0,12,0\"&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;StackPanel&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;DataTemplate&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;ListBoxItem&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;TextBlock Text=\"{Binding Title}\" /&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/ListBoxItem&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;\n> &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Grid&gt;\n\n#### Windows Store\nThe store app is just as easy. &nbsp;In MainPage.xaml, add a GridView controls, set the ItemsSource to {Binding Headlines, Mode=TwoWay}, but in this case I'll define an ItemTemplate outside of the control called PCLItemTemplate and display the Title and the Description.\n\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;GridView ItemsSource=\"{Binding Headlines, Mode=TwoWay}\" Grid.Row=\"1\" ItemTemplate=\"{StaticResource PCLItemTemplate}\" /&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Page.Resources&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;DataTemplate x:Key=\"PCLItemTemplate\"&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;StackPanel Orientation=\"Vertical\" Width=\"500\" Height=\"250\"&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp;

([http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/gg597391(v=vs.110).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/gg597391(v=vs.110).aspx))\n\n### MVVM Light\nWhere I have found it for me is in Windows Store and Windows Phone (7.5 and 8) with [MVVM Light](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/). I have been using this MVVM framework exclusively for a few years now on Silverlight, WPF, Windows Phone and now Windows Store platforms and each release gets better.\n\nMost recently, another MVVM Light fan, [Oren Novotny](http://novotny.org/blog)&nbsp;([@onovotny](http://twitter.com/onovotny)) ported the MVVM Light project and made it possible to use it in a Portable Class Library. This is great, code reuse is the ultimate time saver. And when developing Windows Store Apps or a Windows Phone App; making a complimentary piece for the other just makes sense when the UI is really the only difference and even that is almost the same.\n\n### Example Project\nOpen Visual Studio 2012 and create a new project. &nbsp;I like to start with the \"**_Other Project Types_**\" and select the Blank Visual Studio Solution; name it **MvvmPortable **and click save. Next add a Windows Store App (C# Blank Template) and call it **Mvvm.Store**. Add a new Windows Phone 8 project to the solution named **Mvvm.Phone**.\n\nNow add a new project to the solution and select the \"_Portable Class Library_\" project type.\n\nClick OK and then you'll be presented with a dialog to choose the platforms to be supported. Select all except XBox and for **Windows Phone choose 7.5 or higher**. (_An error will occur when adding the nuget packages later if the 'Windows Phone 7.1 or higher' option is chosen_).\n\nClick OK and now the MVVM Light packages can start to be added via nuget.\n\n### Nuget\nIf you are &nbsp;not using nuget, please pause here and go to [nuget.org](http://nuget.org/) and/or install via Tools-&gt;Extensions And Updates.\n\nMvvm.PCL Project\nRight click the project and select the Manage Nuget Packages and in the dialog search for \"**Portable.MvvmLightLibs**\" and be sure that the Include Pre-release option is on, or you can use the package manager console and use the command **_install package portable.mvvmlightlibs -prerelease_**.\n\nRepeat this process for the Windows Phone and Windows Store projects.\n\nNext we need to add the MVVM Light specific platform assemblies to each of the respective platforms and do some setup and cleanup to make this all work.\n\nRight Click the Windows Store project, select Manage Nuget Packages and search for MVVM Light and click the install button. In doing so, a few folders and files will be added to the project and you may see some errors which we'll clean up and repeat the process for the Phone project.\n\n### Moving ViewModelLocator,ViewModels and Wiring it Up\nNow on to the fun! In the Mvvm.PCL project create a folder call ViewModel in the root of the project. Then expand the  ViewModel folder in the Mvvm.Store project and select the ViewModelLocator.cs and MainViewModel.cs file and cut and paste those to the ViewModel folder in the Mvvm.PCL project.Open each of those and change the namespace to Mvvm.PCL.ViewModel from Mvvm.Store.ViewModel.Since the ViewModelLocator has moved, the store app needs to know where to find it and the ViewModels, so open the App.xaml file in the Mvvm.Store project and change:> &nbsp;xmlns:vm=\"using:Mvvm.Store.ViewModel\"&nbsp;to\n\n> &nbsp;xmlns:vm=\"using:Mvvm.PCL.ViewModel\"&nbsp;\nand we need to modify the Resources section because the nuget installer for MvvmLight puts in some extra entries for the ViewModelLocator\n\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;ResourceDictionary&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;vm:ViewModelLocator p7:Key=\"Locator\" p8:IsDataSource=\"True\"\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xmlns:p8=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008\"\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xmlns:p7=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\" /&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;!--\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Styles that define common aspects of the platform look and feel\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Required by Visual Studio project and item templates\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;ResourceDictionary Source=\"Common/StandardStyles.xaml\" /&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; \n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/ResourceDictionary&gt;\nFinally for the Store app we'll go to the MainPage.xaml and set the DataContext and add a TextBlock to be filled from the MainViewModel.cs in the portable class library that we'll add following that.\n\nIn the MainView.xaml page add the DataContext property at the top of the page after the other declarations.\n\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; ...\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; xmlns:mc=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006\"\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; mc:Ignorable=\"d\"\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; DataContext=\"{Binding Main, Source={StaticResource Locator}}\"\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &gt;Next in the grid add the TextBlock as follows\n\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Grid Background=\"{StaticResource ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush}\"&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;TextBlock Foreground=\"White\" FontSize=\"42\" Text=\"{Binding Hello, Mode=TwoWay}\" /&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Grid&gt;If you compile the store project at this point you will get some errors concerning MvvmLight confilcts. These occur because there are class duplicates in the portable and in the specific versions of the assemblies. &nbsp;In order to alleviate the errors, expand the references folder in the project and select the *.Win8 assemblies and delete them.\n\nAdding Hello to MainViewModel\nNow that the wiring up of the relocated ViewModelLocator and MainViewModel are completed we can add the simple \"Hello\" property in the MainViewModel so it can be bound to in the store project.\n\nOpen MainViewModel.cs and add the property as follows:\n\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; private string _hello = \"Hello\";\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public string Hello\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; get\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return _hello;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _hello = value;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RaisePropertyChanged(() =&gt; Hello);\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\nSet the store project as the default project to run and either run in the simulator or on your local machine and you should see \"Hello\" appear in the top left of the application.\n\n### Wiring up the Phone Project\nThe process here is pretty much the same as was done for the store project.  Instead of moving the ViewModel folder in the phone project; it can be deleted.Open the App.xaml and make the adjustments to let the application know where the ViewModelLocator and ViewModels are located. Note that making these references in the phone project are different that in the store project, albeit subtle can trip you up.Change  > &nbsp;...xmlns:vm=\"clr-namespace:Mvvm.Phone.ViewModel\" mc:Ignorable=\"d\"&gt;to> &nbsp;...xmlns:vm=\"clr-namespace:Mvvm.PCL.ViewModel;assembly=Mvvm.PCL\"&gt;then make the modifications to the Application.Resources portion as follows:> &nbsp; &lt;Application.Resources&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;local:LocalizedStrings xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:Mvvm.Phone\" x:Key=\"LocalizedStrings\" /&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;vm:ViewModelLocator p6:Key=\"Locator\"\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;p7:IsDataSource=\"True\" xmlns:p7=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008\"\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xmlns:p6=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\" /&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Application.Resources&gt;Next, open the MainPage.xaml and add the DataContext declaration and the TextBlock as we did for the store application.\n> ... \n> shell:SystemTray.IsVisible=\"True\"\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; DataContext=\"{Binding Main, Source={StaticResource Locator}}\"&gt;\nadding the TextBlock> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Grid x:Name=\"ContentPanel\" Grid.Row=\"1\" Margin=\"12,0,12,0\"&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;TextBlock Text=\"{Binding Hello, Mode=TwoWay}\" Foreground=\"White\" FontSize=\"18\" /&gt;\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Grid&gt;\nAnd finally as mentioned in the store project, you will get the assembly conflicts so be sure to remove the .*WP8 references in the phone project prior to building the solution here.\n\nRun the application and you'll see the Hello presented in the same location on the phone app.\n\n### Wrapping Up\nAll of the other capabilities that you may or may not be familiar with in the MVVM Light framework is still available to you within the specific projects or of you'd like extract those as well too. &nbsp;I find that the navigation and switching of the views is still best served within the specific platforms.\n\nI have in my projects moved services negotiation for getting data into the PCL assembly using the Microsfoft.BCL.Async library via nuget too and that is also great but a little different depending on your experience with the platform and WebClient versus HttpClient requests.\n\nEnjoy and feel free to ask questions.\n\n[Part 2 - Adding a Data Service](http://blog.tattoocoder.com/2013/01/portable-mvvm-light-move-your-view_28.html)","html":"<h3 id=\"portableclasslibrariesnbsp\">Portable Class Libraries&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>Portable Class Libraries were added as a project type in the interest of creating an assembly that you could use across the .NET Framework, Silverlight, Windows Phone 7, or Xbox 360 platforms without modifications. &nbsp;Well, not really that easy. &nbsp;There is some work to do and as you get into the development of PCLs you'll find out that there is really a sliver of what you'd hope is supported.

Then expand the  ViewModel folder in the Mvvm.Store project and select the ViewModelLocator.cs and MainViewModel.cs file and cut and paste those to the ViewModel folder in the Mvvm.PCL project.Open each of those and change the namespace to Mvvm.PCL.ViewModel from Mvvm.Store.ViewModel.Since the ViewModelLocator has moved, the store app needs to know where to find it and the ViewModels, so open the App.xaml file in the Mvvm.Store project and change:> &nbsp;xmlns:vm=\"using:Mvvm.Store.ViewModel\"&nbsp;to</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&nbsp;xmlns:vm=\"using:Mvvm.PCL.ViewModel\"&nbsp;\n  and we need to modify the Resources section because the nuget installer for MvvmLight puts in some extra entries for the ViewModelLocator</p>\n  \n  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;ResourceDictionary&gt;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;vm:ViewModelLocator p7:Key=\"Locator\" p8:IsDataSource=\"True\"\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xmlns:p8=\"<a href='http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008'>http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008</a>\"\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xmlns:p7=\"<a href='http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml'>http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml</a>\" /&gt;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries&gt;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;!--\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Styles that define common aspects of the platform look and feel\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Required by Visual Studio project and item templates\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--&gt;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;ResourceDictionary Source=\"Common/StandardStyles.xaml\" /&gt;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries&gt;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; \n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/ResourceDictionary&gt;\n  Finally for the Store app we'll go to the MainPage.xaml and set the DataContext and add a TextBlock to be filled from the MainViewModel.cs in the portable class library that we'll add following that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the MainView.xaml page add the DataContext property at the top of the page after the other declarations.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ...\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; xmlns:mc=\"<a href='http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006'>http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006</a>\"\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; mc:Ignorable=\"d\"\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; DataContext=\"{Binding Main, Source={StaticResource Locator}}\"\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &gt;Next in the grid add the TextBlock as follows</p>\n  \n  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Grid Background=\"{StaticResource ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush}\"&gt;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;TextBlock Foreground=\"White\" FontSize=\"42\" Text=\"{Binding Hello, Mode=TwoWay}\" /&gt;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Grid&gt;If you compile the store project at this point you will get some errors concerning MvvmLight confilcts. These occur because there are class duplicates in the portable and in the specific versions of the assemblies. &nbsp;In order to alleviate the errors, expand the references folder in the project and select the *.Win8 assemblies and delete them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Adding Hello to MainViewModel <br />\nNow that the wiring up of the relocated ViewModelLocator and MainViewModel are completed we can add the simple \"Hello\" property in the MainViewModel so it can be bound to in the store project.</p>\n\n<p>Open MainViewModel.cs and add the property as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; private string _hello = \"Hello\";\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public string Hello\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; get\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return _hello;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _hello = value;\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RaisePropertyChanged(() =&gt; Hello);\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }\n  Set the store project as the default project to run and either run in the simulator or on your local machine and you should see \"Hello\" appear in the top left of the application.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"wiringupthephoneproject\">Wiring up the Phone Project</h3>\n\n<p>The process here is pretty much the same as was done for the store project.  Instead of moving the ViewModel folder in the phone project; it can be deleted.Open the App.xaml and make the adjustments to let the application know where the ViewModelLocator and ViewModels are located.

This first one is just a RSS type application for DZone.com, but it just the first version and the next installment will add more content. &nbsp;If you have ever planned a good, cross platform application before you may or may not understand that picking the right tools for job are important, and yes even what you're using for the front end language matters sometimes as it did in my case here.\n\nHere is a run down of the application architecture components:\n\n*   Node.js REST API on Azure\n\n*   [Express ](http://expressjs.com/api.html):&nbsp;MVC type framework for Node.js for routing, rendering, HTTP Listener\n*   [Memory-Cache](https://github.com/ptarjan/node-cache) : memory caching on server\n*   [Cheerio](https://github.com/MatthewMueller/cheerio)&nbsp;: JQuery on the server, lightweight simple HTML parsing\n*   [Async ](https://github.com/caolan/async): parallel library for Node.js&nbsp;*   Windows 8TypeScript was also used in the Node.js project as well to build out some of the model objects.I wanted my app to present more.

I chose to go with Node.js on Azure to solve this challenge.**Node.js** ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)) -&nbsp;_Node.js is a packaged compilation of Google's V8 JavaScript engine, the libUV platform abstraction layer, and a core library, which is itself primarily written in JavaScript.&nbsp;__Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl starting in 2009, and its growth is sponsored by Joyent, his employer._\n_\n_Node also has Node Package Manager (npm) which I would or most would say is the equivelant to .NET's nuget package library repository for getting community contributed libraries for accomplishing common tasks such as caching, async and so forth.\n\nI hadn't used node before but I have plenty of JavaScript experience and it was on my list of \"want to learn\" this year. &nbsp;I was recently asked why node instead of Web API, other just to say \"I used node.js\"? &nbsp;Good question, and a legit one too. &nbsp;So here is the answer;\n\nWeb API is great, I love it and give a talk on \"Why you should be using it\" at code camps quite often. &nbsp;However, I found that using C# to parse HTML to not be as flexible and lacked performance in comparison to using Cheerio (JQuery on node.js) when outside of the standard RSS or ATOM formatted feeds. JavaScript is really great at parsing strings. &nbsp;Secondly, the ability for me to make routes in Express was really easy in comparison to ASP.NET. &nbsp;For example, in ASP.NET if I wanted to setup a route to handle a controller / action / id route; there are changes needed in the routing configuration as well as potential changes in the controller too. \n\n#### Routing Config\n\nroutes.MapHttpRoute(\n&nbsp; &nbsp; name: \"myNewRouteAction\",\n&nbsp; &nbsp; routeTemplate: \"api/{controller}/{action}/{id}\",\n&nbsp; &nbsp; defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }\n);\n\n#### Controller Code\n\npublic class ProductsController : ApiController \n{  &nbsp; \n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[HttpGet]  &nbsp; \n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public string Details(int id) &nbsp;{ ... }\n}\n\nOr \n\npublic class ProductsController : ApiController\n{ &nbsp; \n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public string GetDetails(int id) { ... }\n} \n\nThis sets up the API for the action name to be in the url like **_http://localhost/api/products/details/1_**. By contrast in node the same is accomplished with Express.js by doing the following\n\napp.get('/api/products/details/:id', function(request, response) { ... }); \n\nNext, in node I can take advantage of running multiple processes at once for checking for updates while also hosting a REST API for the application. &nbsp;In another application there are two worker roles in Azure, basically Windows Services, doing this type of work and a single Web role for my Web API. &nbsp;This allows for me to consolidate the processes into one right now and if the need arises I can break the back end architecture into multiple processes.&nbsp;Flexibility&nbsp;and some simplicity I like here. Here is an example where 3 processes are running at once doing tasks at different intervals all non-blocking.\n\n#### app.js&nbsp;\nvar job = function() {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;console.log(\"working at 1 second.\");\n&nbsp;};\nvar job2 = function() {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;console.log(\"working at 3 seconds.\");\n};\nsetInterval(job, 1000);\nsetInterval(job2, 3000);   \n\n#### Ouput in Console\n\nFinally, I chose JavaScript/HTML for the UI portions which I'll cover more reasons why later and it's nice to code JavaScript everywhere.\n\n### C#/XAML or HTML5/JavaScript/CSS3 ?\nNow I will mention that C# is my first language of choice when diving into any new project and in fact that is what I initially started with, but I found that when getting the contents of the RSS feeds, which were non-standard formatted and in order to consume RSS nicely in C# or VB.NET you have a dependency on the SyndicationFeed assembly which is good and bad. Good if the feed is formatted in the standard RSS or ATOM formats, but bad if the provider has extended it.Once more the article content was also available in nice print formatted HTML, however when using C# in Windows 8 you must embed a browser control and the flow is not fluid in landscape mode.  At least, not the way it should intuitively should appear. However in JavaScript you can take the HTML from the print view and set the innerHTML equal to the result and sprinkle some CSS in there and you are set. No fuss. So HTML5 is the choice here.In making the decision there are some features that I really enjoy about the language and the ability to create Windows applications versus XAML. There is a clear separation of concerns between what is Presentation, Styling, and Logic that I think I had taken for granted in my web development projects.  When using C# and XAML I really structure my project with MVVM pattern using MVVM Light, use some naming convention on my files and folder structures to ensure that just by looking at the project I know what does what where.In a JavaScript Windows 8 project it's clear, just in the tooling and file types.  Now make no mistake you can embed all of the CSS and JavaScript right in the HTML and spaghetti it all up just like anything.  However, the templates and the maturity of the tool set and language almost keeps you from doing so.The HTML5 support in Blend is also great, especially when seeing what CSS styles are applied to what HTML elements, and using the tooling to create a new style from an existing style.  I encourage you to view the video on blendinsider.com .Some other items I'll quickly mention that I like about JavaScript projects in Windows 8CSSmultiple background layers and overall styling much easier than XAMLSupporting snapping, full, landscape etc through media queries I found much more intuitiveJQuery SupportWho doesn't like JQuery when it comes to getting to the DOM?Web Essentials! not that this has anything specific to do with WIndows 8, but if you are doing any HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript development you MUST get this.  I have been using this for a while and it continues to get better and now has its own dedicated site as http://vswebessentials.com/I will still use C# and XAML as it is my first set of tools, but don't forget the others in the box.  There have been some fantastic tools thrown at the developers and some are very quick to poo poo the idea of a new coding language or application of an existing language in a different way.  Pick what best works towards the success of the project.Here are a few resources for HTML5 and JavaScript Development for Windows 8 https://www.meetmyapp.in/meetmyapp/windows_8_build.aspx - Design Templates!!!

So I fired up a new Javascript Windows Store project in Visual Studio to give it a shot to see if it all works. &nbsp;Before we get started make sure that you have the following:\n\n*   Windows 8 &amp; VS2012\n*   Download the plugin:&nbsp;[http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=266563](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=266563)\n*   VS 2012 Web Essentials:&nbsp;[http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6)\n\n### Create a New Project\nStart by creating a new project. I just went with the \"Blank App\" template for purposes of this post, but any of the installed templates are certainly applicable.Click \"OK\" and you will see that in the Solution Explorer the following structure.  Expand the \"js\" folder to see the javascript files that are there by default.\n\n### Adding the TypeScript Functionality\nThere are a couple of files that are needed to making TypeScript and Windows 8 play nicely together, as well as jQuery.  The best way to describe these is that they are wrappers for the WinJS, WinRT and JQuery or helpers.  There is also lib.d.ts which is a noted in the file as \"ECMA Script APIs\" Click on any of these to see the source.winjs.d.tswinrt.d.tsjquery.d.tslib.d.tsI downloaded all of these and now put them in a folder called tsWin in the project for referencing in my other ts files.In the examples that have been shown online, by simply adding a .ts file to your project and hitting save; Visual Studio will automatically create the .js file and associate it to the TypeScript file and show the compiled javascript in the split window.  However, this is not the case in a Windows Store Application...Yet.But we can still make this all work, here's how.Add a new javascript file to the js folder BUT name it with the extension .ts. I named the file Data.ts.  Next, repeat and name the file Data.js. Your solution explorer should look like this now. Note that I also added the tsWin folder and the mentioned files as well.<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sBsmbG_oEtU/UHRctAAfecI/AAAAAAAAAWo/hxlg24iVHew/s400/AddNewFiles.PNG)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sBsmbG_oEtU/UHRctAAfecI/AAAAAAAAAWo/hxlg24iVHew/s1600/AddNewFiles.PNG)</td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\n</td></tr></tbody></table>Now you can open the data.ts file and get the split window that has been presented and see that the .js file that is compiled on the right. There is another file here that is important as well called win.ts, it adds a wrapper for setImmediate and references the winrt.d.ts and winjs.d.t.s files.  I reference this file in any of the TypeScript that I am using but put it within the js folder.\n\n### A Quick Example\nSo here is a quick example that will walk through the following concepts:Creating a simple classExtending the class through inheritanceUsing Location ServicesRetrieving a static map from Google Maps APIInserting the image control onto the page.Open the data.ts file.  We will first create the initial Location class and the MyLocation class in TypeScript  and see the output to javascript.TypeScript:///<reference path=\"win.ts\">module Data {    class Location {        longitude: any;        latitude: any;        url: string;    }    class MyLocation extends Location {        retrieved: any;    }};Javascript:var __extends = this.__extends || function (d, b) {    function __() { this.constructor = d; }    __.prototype = b.prototype;    d.prototype = new __();}var Data;(function (Data) {    var Location = (function () {        function Location() { }        return Location;    })();       var MyLocation = (function (_super) {        __extends(MyLocation, _super);        function MyLocation() {            _super.apply(this, arguments);        }        return MyLocation;    })(Location);   })(Data || (Data = {}));; ;Screen shot just to visualize what's show in VS 2012Not sure about you, but I wouldn't want to write the inheritance code for Javscript, TypeScript kills it there! Ok, let's move on. Next I will add the function to get the location from the device, populate the myLoc object and then create and insert the image into the body of the page.Note that the TypeScript and Javacript to do this are one and the same, difference here is that we have type safe code.TypeScript:  var locator = new Windows.Devices.Geolocation.Geolocator();  locator.getGeopositionAsync().then(function (pos) {        var myLoc = new MyLocation();      myLoc.latitude = pos.coordinate.latitude;      myLoc.longitude = pos.coordinate.longitude;      myLoc.retrieved = Date.now;      myLoc.url = \"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=\"          + myLoc.latitude + \",\" + myLoc.longitude          + \"&zoom=12&size=400x400&sensor=false\";      // add a new img tag to the document      var img = document.createElement(\"img\");      // set the src and style      img.setAttribute(\"src\", myLoc.url);      img.setAttribute(\"style\", \"height:400px;width:400px;\");              // get the paragraph tag we set for the location of the content      var p = document.body.getElementsByTagName(\"p\")[0];      p.appendChild(img);When you hit save you'll notice that on the status bar at the bottom left of Visual Studio it will read \"Compiling TypeScript...\" and then the resulting Javascript will refresh/show on the right pane.  It is important to note that if you have the ,js file open you will get the prompt \"Such and such file is open would you like to reload\".Before you run the application make sure that you enable the Location capabilities in the package manifest file as shown below or you will get a nasty message box letting you know you didn't.Ok, hit F5 and see the results.First you'll get the let me use location services prompt.And then the page is presented with the downloaded map.That's a little get started primer on TypeScript and Windows Store Apps!  Pretty awesome stuff.Tips & Tricks</reference>\n\n#### Content / Package Type\nMake sure that all of the TypeScript (.ts) files are marked as None so they are not distributed unnecessarily with your application. \n\n#### Debugging\nYou can put break points in the generated .js files and have access to the immediate window, watch etc.\n\n#### Dependent Files\nI like to see the dependent files like I'm used to seeing in other project types (see below).  Since this is not built in to the Windows Store functionality with TypeScript yet, here is how to do it.You need to edit the project file.  The best way to do this is to use the Power Commands for Visual Studio extension, or browse to it and open in notepad or some other text editor.<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SyPYCvo47uI/UHRukrMHldI/AAAAAAAAAX8/lmfi9arHPHQ/s400/PowerCommands.PNG)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SyPYCvo47uI/UHRukrMHldI/AAAAAAAAAX8/lmfi9arHPHQ/s1600/PowerCommands.PNG)</td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">PowerCommands for Visual Studio</td></tr></tbody></table>For this solution locate the data.ts reference in the file and change it to the following:    <content include=\"js\\data.js\">      <dependentupon>data.ts</dependentupon>    </content>    <none include=\"js\\data.ts\"></none>Save the file and reload the project and you can now see that the .js file will be shown below the .ts file.ConclusionI have had some real fun getting into this and trying it out with the Store apps.  Coming from a C# / XAML life for the last many years, it will be interesting for me to back to some scripting.  I like the option and I see some really cool opportunities with TypeScript.DOWNLOAD THE CODE FOR THE EXAMPLE","html":"<h3 id=\"whatistypescriptnbsp\">What is TypeScript?&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/\">http://www.typescriptlang.org</a></p>\n\n<p>TypeScript was recently released and has become the new hot topic. &nbsp;One of the questions I have asked and heard is can we use this for developing Windows Store Applications with Javascript and have the cool features that have been shown in the videos and examples.</p>\n\n<p>One of the great features was the split window feature where you can code in TypeScript on the left and upon hitting save, it compiles to Javascript on the left.

Next I will add the function to get the location from the device, populate the myLoc object and then create and insert the image into the body of the page.Note that the TypeScript and Javacript to do this are one and the same, difference here is that we have type safe code.TypeScript:  var locator = new Windows.Devices.Geolocation.Geolocator();  locator.getGeopositionAsync().then(function (pos) {        var myLoc = new MyLocation();      myLoc.latitude = pos.coordinate.latitude;      myLoc.longitude = pos.coordinate.longitude;      myLoc.retrieved = Date.now;      myLoc.url = \"<a href='http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center='>http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=</a>\"          + myLoc.latitude + \",\" + myLoc.longitude          + \"&amp;zoom=12&amp;size=400x400&amp;sensor=false\";      // add a new img tag to the document      var img = document.createElement(\"img\");      // set the src and style      img.setAttribute(\"src\", myLoc.url);      img.setAttribute(\"style\", \"height:400px;width:400px;\");              // get the paragraph tag we set for the location of the content      var p = document.body.getElementsByTagName(\"p\")[0];      p.appendChild(img);When you hit save you'll notice that on the status bar at the bottom left of Visual Studio it will read \"Compiling TypeScript...\" and then the resulting Javascript will refresh/show on the right pane.  It is important to note that if you have the ,js file open you will get the prompt \"Such and such file is open would you like to reload\".Before you run the application make sure that you enable the Location capabilities in the package manifest file as shown below or you will get a nasty message box letting you know you didn't.Ok, hit F5 and see the results.First you'll get the let me use location services prompt.And then the page is presented with the downloaded map.That's a little get started primer on TypeScript and Windows Store Apps!  Pretty awesome stuff.Tips &amp; Tricks</reference></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"contentpackagetype\">Content / Package Type</h4>\n\n<p>Make sure that all of the TypeScript (.ts) files are marked as None so they are not distributed unnecessarily with your application. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"debugging\">Debugging</h4>\n\n<p>You can put break points in the generated .js files and have access to the immediate window, watch etc.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"dependentfiles\">Dependent Files</h4>\n\n<p>I like to see the dependent files like I'm used to seeing in other project types (see below).  Since this is not built in to the Windows Store functionality with TypeScript yet, here is how to do it.You need to edit the project file.  The best way to do this is to use the Power Commands for Visual Studio extension, or browse to it and open in notepad or some other text editor.<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SyPYCvo47uI/UHRukrMHldI/AAAAAAAAAX8/lmfi9arHPHQ/s1600/PowerCommands.PNG\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SyPYCvo47uI/UHRukrMHldI/AAAAAAAAAX8/lmfi9arHPHQ/s400/PowerCommands.PNG\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">PowerCommands for Visual Studio</td></tr></tbody></table>For this solution locate the data.ts reference in the file and change it to the following:    <content include=\"js\\data.js\">      <dependentupon>data.ts</dependentupon>    </content>    <none include=\"js\\data.ts\"></none>Save the file and reload the project and you can now see that the .js file will be shown below the .ts file.ConclusionI have had some real fun getting into this and trying it out with the Store apps.  Coming from a C# / XAML life for the last many years, it will be interesting for me to back to some scripting.  I like the option and I see some really cool opportunities with TypeScript.DOWNLOAD THE CODE FOR THE EXAMPLE</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1349808480001,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1350055518458,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1349808480001,"published_by":1},{"id":24,"uuid":"20c58a09-60ad-47d9-8138-2f8b20bdfd5b","title":"Richmond Code Camp","slug":"richmond_code_camp","markdown":"I will be giving two talks this Saturday at&nbsp;[Richmond Code Camp](http://richmondcodecamp.org/), being held at the University of Richmond in Richmond, Va.&nbsp; For directions and more information visit [http://richmondcodecamp.org/](http://richmondcodecamp.org/)and/or follow @CodeCamp on Twitter.

Yes I care what it looks like even for this. Go ahead and add the following below the &lt;Grid&gt; tag to add the header to the initial page.&nbsp; You can change the title if you like and run (F5).\n\n<pre class=\"brush:xml\">&lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;RowDefinition Height=\"140\"/&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;RowDefinition Height=\"*\"/&gt;\n&lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;\n\n&lt;Grid&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ColumnDefinition Width=\"Auto\"/&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ColumnDefinition Width=\"*\"/&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;Button x:Name=\"backButton\"&nbsp; Style=\"{StaticResource BackButtonStyle}\"/&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;TextBlock x:Name=\"pageTitle\" Text=\"Rad Custom Hub Tile\" Grid.Column=\"1\" IsHitTestVisible=\"false\" Style=\"{StaticResource PageHeaderTextStyle}\" Foreground=\"#FFADD808\"/&gt;\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\n</pre>\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wNthFGNkBGg/UGJrumR5TRI/AAAAAAAAAVc/6ZFQ4gAtxoM/s400/Title_xaml.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wNthFGNkBGg/UGJrumR5TRI/AAAAAAAAAVc/6ZFQ4gAtxoM/s1600/Title_xaml.png)</td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Title and Back button</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nNext, lets add the RadCustomHubTile Control, and the best way to do this is to simply drag it from the toolbox right into the spot within the XAML. This is something you could not do in Windows Phone which is a big step in my opinion.\n\nIt will add the namespace and the references to the project.\n\nTo clean it up a little and make sure that you are using within the design guidelines, wrap the RadHubControl with a Grid with the following settings.\n\n<pre class=\"brush:xml\">&lt;Grid Grid.Row=\"1\" Margin=\"115,0,0,0\"&gt;\n\n&nbsp; &lt;Primitives:RadCustomHubTile /&gt;\n\n&lt;/Grid&gt;</pre>\nIf you are wondering why my RadCustomHubTile is prefixed, it is because I have changed or altered the declaration at the top of the page to be the following (this matches my Phone app stuff).\n\n> xmlns:Primitives=\"using:Telerik.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives\"&nbsp;\n\n### Setting Front and Back Content\nThe content for the front and back are defined by setting the content within the <radcustomhubtile.frontcontent> and <radcustomhubtile.backcontent> respectively.  Pretty simple, so here is an example:</radcustomhubtile.backcontent></radcustomhubtile.frontcontent><pre class=\"brush:xml\">&lt;Primitives:RadCustomHubTile Height=\"300\" Width=\"300\"&gt;\n &lt;Primitives:RadCustomHubTile.FrontContent&gt;\n  &lt;Grid&gt;\n   &lt;Image x:Name=\"imgBlogger\" \n        Source=\"{Binding Photo, Mode=TwoWay}\" \n        Height=\"300\" Width=\"300\" \n        Stretch=\"UniformToFill\" Margin=\"0\" \n        HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" \n        VerticalAlignment=\"Center\" /&gt;\n\n   &lt;Rectangle Height=\"65\" Fill=\"#99000000\" VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\" /&gt;\n\n   &lt;StackPanel Orientation=\"Horizontal\"&gt;\n    &lt;TextBlock  Text=\"Blogger:\" \n        Foreground=\"White\" Width=\"126\" Height=\"43\" \n        VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\" \n        Margin=\"10,0,0,14\" Style=\"{StaticResource SubheaderTextStyle}\" \n        HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" /&gt;\n\n    &lt;TextBlock  Text=\"{Binding UserName}\" \n        Foreground=\"White\" Height=\"43\" \n        VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\" Margin=\"0,0,0,14\" \n        Style=\"{StaticResource SubheaderTextStyle}\"/&gt;\n   &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n  &lt;/Grid&gt;\n &lt;/Primitives:RadCustomHubTile.FrontContent&gt;\n\n &lt;Primitives:RadCustomHubTile.BackContent&gt;\n  &lt;Grid&gt;\n   &lt;Image x:Name=\"img\" \n         Source=\"{Binding Thumbnail, Mode=TwoWay}\" \n         Height=\"300\" Width=\"300\" \n         Stretch=\"UniformToFill\" Margin=\"0\" \n         HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" \n         VerticalAlignment=\"Center\" /&gt;\n\n   &lt;Rectangle Height=\"65\" Fill=\"#99000000\" VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\" /&gt;\n\n   &lt;TextBlock  Text=\"{Binding Title, Mode=TwoWay}\" \n        Foreground=\"White\" Width=\"270\" Height=\"30\" \n        VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\"  \n        Margin=\"0,0,0,30\" Style=\"{StaticResource BasicTextStyle}\" /&gt;\n\n   &lt;TextBlock  Text=\"{Binding SubTitle, Mode=TwoWay}\" \n        Foreground=\"White\" Width=\"270\" Height=\"30\" \n        VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\" Margin=\"0,0,0,5\" \n        Style=\"{StaticResource BasicTextStyle}\"/&gt;\n  &lt;/Grid&gt;\n &lt;/Primitives:RadCustomHubTile.BackContent&gt;\n&lt;/Primitives:RadCustomHubTile&gt;\n\n</pre>\nNote that you will want to wrap your content with the FrontContent / BackContent tags in Grid, StackPanel etc as the designer will give you the \"Content cannot be set more than once error\".\n\nHere is the MainViewModel that is bound. Note that the Blogger image (me), is pulled from an internet source uri and the back image is pulled from the project itself. The string properties are bound simply.\n\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp\">using GalaSoft.MvvmLight;\nusing System;\nusing Windows.UI.Xaml.Media;\nusing Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Imaging;\n\nnamespace RadHubTile.ViewModel\n{\n    public class MainViewModel : ViewModelBase\n    {\n        /// &lt;summary&gt;\n        /// Initializes a new instance of the MainViewModel class.\n        /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n        public MainViewModel() { }\n\n        public string Photo\n        {\n            get { return \"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yBHsXXtsWWo/UCkc916wnfI/AAAAAAAAAN0/FcKOE2P-gGQ/s1600/profilepic.png\"; }\n        }\n\n        public string UserName\n        {\n            get { return \"Shayne Boyer\"; }\n        }\n\n        public ImageSource Thumbnail\n        {\n            get { return new BitmapImage(new System.Uri(new Uri(\"ms-appx:\"), \"/Assets/RadCustomHubTile.png\"));}\n        }\n\n        public string Title\n        {\n            get { return \"Telerik Windows 8 UI Controls\"; }\n        }\n\n        public string SubTitle\n        {\n            get { return \"RadCustomHubTile\"; }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n</pre>\n\nSo what does it all look like?\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\nOne other item to note is that you can alter the duration of the flip/rotation by setting the UpdateInterval which is a TimeSpan. So setting the value to \"0:0:5\" would be equal to 5 seconds. &nbsp;There is also FlowDirection and many other properties to customize the Tile to your liking. &nbsp;I'd like to see what you can do with it. &nbsp;Download the controls today and let me know what you working on and if you have any questions.","html":"<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.telerik.com/\">Telerik</a> recently released their <a href=\"http://www.telerik.com/products/windows-metro/overview.aspx\">Windows 8 UI Controls</a> to RC&nbsp;on September 18th (<a href=\"http://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/posts/12-09-18/what-s-new-in-telerik-windows-8-ui-controls-release-candidate.aspx?utm_source=spboyer\">see post here</a>), and this is probably on the first in a series of posts I will put out showing them off.</p>\n\n<p>The first control here is the RadCustomHubTile.&nbsp; I chose this because I am in the process of porting my <a href=\"http://spboyer.me/AboutAmberApp\">Find Amber app from Windows Phone</a> to Windows&nbsp;8 and I wanted to transition the app without drifting too far from the spirit of the original app.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OoJxg94Y9sg/UFtzIhwbmQI/AAAAAAAAAU8/_9KJDXTNF2g/s320/promoimage.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OoJxg94Y9sg/UFtzIhwbmQI/AAAAAAAAAU8/_9KJDXTNF2g/s1600/promoimage.png)</td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">RadControls from Telerik used here for  \nCurrent List and Search &amp; Stats section</td></tr></tbody></table>You can see from the screen shot&nbsp;that I had already used the [RadControls for Windows Phone](http://www.telerik.com/products/windows-phone.aspx), so now I can bring some of the design through.\n\nThe controls do support both HTML and XAML design, if the current version of the controls do not include either or; I assure you the version you seek is in development and on its way.\n\n### Getting Started\nThe RadCustomHubTile allows **any **user-defined content rather than predefined parts that you may find in a RadHubTile or RadSlideTile, and as in most if not all of the Telerik controls; MVVM as well as code based binding is supported.\n\nPrior to trying this example, please [download the controls from Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/download-trial-file.aspx?pid=981) and note that I am using MVVM Light as the MVVM Framework.&nbsp; You can see how to install MVVM Light via nuget by opening the Package Manager console and running \"Install-Package mvvmlight\".&nbsp; If you have any trouble with that please see [http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/)&nbsp;or contact me via [twitter (@spboyer)](http://twitter.com/spboyer)&nbsp;OR see my blog post on [how to get started with Windows 8 and MVVM Light](http://blog.tattoocoder.com/2012/08/getting-started-w-windows-8-mvvm-light.html).\n\nIn the following example you will see:\n\n*   MVVM Binding\n*   Content locally bound\n*   Content bound from an internet URI\n*   Complex front and back content for the tileThis is a moderately simply example.&nbsp; I started with a Blank Solution in Visual Studio 2012 and called it RadCustomHubTile (in retrospect probably should have stuck with App1).\n\nInstall the MVVM Light Framework via nuget (see above), you will have to make a change to the App.xaml file.&nbsp; When installing this, it adds the reference to the namespace in the old way\n\n**_&nbsp; xmlns:vm=\"clr-namespace:RadHubTile.ViewModel\" _**\n****\nyou need to change this to:\n\n**_&nbsp;xmlns:vm=\"using:RadHubTile.ViewModel\" _**\n\n&nbsp;A little house keeping to make it look nice.

This is something you could not do in Windows Phone which is a big step in my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>It will add the namespace and the references to the project.</p>\n\n<p>To clean it up a little and make sure that you are using within the design guidelines, wrap the RadHubControl with a Grid with the following settings.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush:xml\">&lt;Grid Grid.Row=\"1\" Margin=\"115,0,0,0\"&gt;\n\n&nbsp; &lt;Primitives:RadCustomHubTile /&gt;\n\n&lt;/Grid&gt;</pre>\nIf you are wondering why my RadCustomHubTile is prefixed, it is because I have changed or altered the declaration at the top of the page to be the following (this matches my Phone app stuff).\n\n> xmlns:Primitives=\"using:Telerik.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives\"&nbsp;\n\n### Setting Front and Back Content\nThe content for the front and back are defined by setting the content within the <radcustomhubtile.frontcontent> and <radcustomhubtile.backcontent> respectively.  Pretty simple, so here is an example:</radcustomhubtile.backcontent></radcustomhubtile.frontcontent><pre class=\"brush:xml\">&lt;Primitives:RadCustomHubTile Height=\"300\" Width=\"300\"&gt;  \n &lt;Primitives:RadCustomHubTile.FrontContent&gt;\n  &lt;Grid&gt;\n   &lt;Image x:Name=\"imgBlogger\" \n        Source=\"{Binding Photo, Mode=TwoWay}\" \n        Height=\"300\" Width=\"300\" \n        Stretch=\"UniformToFill\" Margin=\"0\" \n        HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" \n        VerticalAlignment=\"Center\" /&gt;\n\n   &lt;Rectangle Height=\"65\" Fill=\"#99000000\" VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\" /&gt;\n\n   &lt;StackPanel Orientation=\"Horizontal\"&gt;\n    &lt;TextBlock  Text=\"Blogger:\" \n        Foreground=\"White\" Width=\"126\" Height=\"43\" \n        VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\" \n        Margin=\"10,0,0,14\" Style=\"{StaticResource SubheaderTextStyle}\" \n        HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" /&gt;\n\n    &lt;TextBlock  Text=\"{Binding UserName}\" \n        Foreground=\"White\" Height=\"43\" \n        VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\" Margin=\"0,0,0,14\" \n        Style=\"{StaticResource SubheaderTextStyle}\"/&gt;\n   &lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n  &lt;/Grid&gt;\n &lt;/Primitives:RadCustomHubTile.FrontContent&gt;\n\n &lt;Primitives:RadCustomHubTile.BackContent&gt;\n  &lt;Grid&gt;\n   &lt;Image x:Name=\"img\" \n         Source=\"{Binding Thumbnail, Mode=TwoWay}\" \n         Height=\"300\" Width=\"300\" \n         Stretch=\"UniformToFill\" Margin=\"0\" \n         HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" \n         VerticalAlignment=\"Center\" /&gt;\n\n   &lt;Rectangle Height=\"65\" Fill=\"#99000000\" VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\" /&gt;\n\n   &lt;TextBlock  Text=\"{Binding Title, Mode=TwoWay}\" \n        Foreground=\"White\" Width=\"270\" Height=\"30\" \n        VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\"  \n        Margin=\"0,0,0,30\" Style=\"{StaticResource BasicTextStyle}\" /&gt;\n\n   &lt;TextBlock  Text=\"{Binding SubTitle, Mode=TwoWay}\" \n        Foreground=\"White\" Width=\"270\" Height=\"30\" \n        VerticalAlignment=\"Bottom\" Margin=\"0,0,0,5\" \n        Style=\"{StaticResource BasicTextStyle}\"/&gt;\n  &lt;/Grid&gt;\n &lt;/Primitives:RadCustomHubTile.BackContent&gt;\n&lt;/Primitives:RadCustomHubTile&gt;\n\n</pre>  \n\n<p>Note that you will want to wrap your content with the FrontContent / BackContent tags in Grid, StackPanel etc as the designer will give you the \"Content cannot be set more than once error\".</p>\n\n<p>Here is the MainViewModel that is bound. Note that the Blogger image (me), is pulled from an internet source uri and the back image is pulled from the project itself.

I went through the initial walkthrough for a Windows 8 application, and during this I wanted to see the data that was going back and fourth so I opened my favorite tool Fiddler to see the HTTP calls, which then lead me to see that I could easily use these services for Windows Phone 7 now!\nHere is a quick walk through a how to get setup.\n\n### Getting Started\nIn order to start using the preview of the Mobile Services in Azure, you need to have a Windows Azure account or you can sign up for a [trial account](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A73D945CB). After you login, go to your Account Center and select the Preview Features from the top menu.\n[![image](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-m3TLdLwRukE/UEDKs3v2Y7I/AAAAAAAAAQw/uwiC3Pvd2sM/image_thumb%25255B4%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \"image\")](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-mi6vAyCc9mo/UEDKsYmP7SI/AAAAAAAAAQo/R2pmRjowwew/s1600-h/image%25255B8%25255D.png)\nI have already signed up for the Mobile Services, so you will see a “try it now” button and go ahead click that to get started. Once you get transferred to the, unfortunately still called the “Preview” portal, you’ll notice on the left menu that there is a new **Mobile Services **section.\n[![image](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-pd8zlUYN3PY/UEDKt38IMWI/AAAAAAAAARA/zGl2O-GQBmY/image_thumb%25255B6%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \"image\")](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-w9S2neZKOU0/UEDKtX8pjnI/AAAAAAAAAQ4/h4jWsXWGzBw/s1600-h/image%25255B12%25255D.png)\nNext on the bottom portion of the management portal you will see the **+**, which you simply click to add the new Mobile Service.\n[![image](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-x1C1w9nZ0bU/UEDKu4wbDXI/AAAAAAAAARQ/bcLhjKyErMc/image_thumb%25255B8%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \"image\")](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-7LnC0ptxMAE/UEDKunx-M6I/AAAAAAAAARI/O0XwDziUaLI/s1600-h/image%25255B16%25255D.png)\nChoose create and the New Mobile Service dialog is presented; enter the name of your new mobile service, select or create a new SQL Server Database, and finally select the Region for your instance.&nbsp; There are some other options in the “Configure advanced database settings” but we’ll not do that now for simplicity sake.\n*** As a note, if you create a new database; remember the credentials.&nbsp; You will need this information if you choose to add another database to the server later.\nUpon completion of the wizard, the management portal will tell you its creating…, the poof its there. I named mine “testmobileservice”.\n[![image](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-cktK68TGW6k/UEDKvQT7omI/AAAAAAAAARg/joWwTjOqsCg/image_thumb%25255B10%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \"image\")](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-20zcXdKrGtM/UEDKvLuhrmI/AAAAAAAAARY/0vf4iwZOlQY/s1600-h/image%25255B20%25255D.png)\nif you click on the URL, you’ll be presented with the following page…\n[![testpage](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-IiGw_llVS_4/UEDKwMK15mI/AAAAAAAAARw/FO2GuJZLvNo/testpage_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800 \"testpage\")](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-OPzv3qWXNnU/UEDKvlKPT0I/AAAAAAAAARo/BM95fWSAKKw/s1600-h/testpage%25255B3%25255D.jpg)\nThese are just services, or a service endpoint. The closest thing I can really relate this to is in SQL 2005 we were given the ability to expose certain objects as web service endpoints, it was a neat feature but not widely used and still available to my knowledge. Sorry I digress, let’s get back to the management portal and create a Todo table. \nIf you click on the Mobile Service name you see the following screen, and although the initial announcement was for Windows 8 support and the walkthroughs etc. show that, let’s just create a table and I can get to Fiddler and show you how the data looks to and from the REST Service.\n[![image](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-4xaueRFPDSs/UEDKwwgvYeI/AAAAAAAAASA/IT1P5Sl989E/image_thumb%25255B14%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \"image\")](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-P-u6EVq8aWg/UEDKwpQVtUI/AAAAAAAAAR4/pwcPaJN77bk/s1600-h/image%25255B28%25255D.png)\nClick over the the DATA tab, then the **+** on the bottom the add the table. Name the table **ToDoItem** and click the check to create the new table.\n[![image](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-tpl2yJHopbQ/UEDKxzAtg7I/AAAAAAAAASQ/dQF08u8V6xk/image_thumb%25255B12%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \"image\")](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-pkn4SKuDTHg/UEDKxRropBI/AAAAAAAAASI/MY391RFPaPY/s1600-h/image%25255B24%25255D.png)\nPretty simple right?&nbsp; Just created a new table in a database by simply naming a table…DBA’s are freaking out around the world right now.\nOk, so go back to the DASHBOARD and find the MANAGE KEYS icon at the bottom, and we are going to add/create a new Application Key for the Mobile Service.&nbsp; \n[![mananagekeyyes](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-RqpfXnxL3FM/UEDNWt8aa3I/AAAAAAAAASw/nvkv2utj2jE/mananagekeyyes_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800 \"mananagekeyyes\")](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-eenpeEKhU28/UEDNWUmY0QI/AAAAAAAAASo/FwYX1WG19MU/s1600-h/mananagekeyyes%25255B2%25255D.jpg)\nNow there are still some things under the covers here that I am still finding the answers too, but my first guess is this is some iteration/flavor of oAuth. But, go ahead and copy down the Application Key that is generated for you.&nbsp; At this point, there is only one key and if you regenerate post deployment then your app will break so be careful with that little regenerate button of power.\n[![image](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-RnHO6xgWzhQ/UEDKywa7I_I/AAAAAAAAASg/aeOegeY0vv0/image_thumb%25255B17%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \"image\")](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-TsIDRKYIssc/UEDKyRNvQWI/AAAAAAAAASY/PlY4wR-GYAs/s1600-h/image%25255B33%25255D.png)\nClick the check mark and you are ready to start.\n\n### Interacting with the Endpoint via REST\nUsing Fiddler to see your HTTP calls going to and from RESTful endpoint is great, BUT there is also a little tab in there that most developers don’t realize is there.&nbsp; It’s the **Composer** tab.&nbsp; You can either originate a call in there OR drag a previous call from the left side to the composer tab and make changes to it and hit the execute button.&nbsp; Great feature!\n[![image](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-e2q63f_GiIg/UEDTdgDOWRI/AAAAAAAAATI/v8F_YrO6Xus/image_thumb%25255B20%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \"image\")](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-LuDLr1CCgiY/UEDTazLGqsI/AAAAAAAAATA/jeGGVnX5PnQ/s1600-h/image%25255B38%25255D.png)\n\n### What are my EndPoints?\nInteresting how this works… \nThe endpoints are formatted as [https://[your new service address](https://[your%20new%20service%20address/)]/tables/[table name]. So in my case, the RESTful endpoint for the TodoItem table is: [https://testmobileservice.azure-mobile.net/tables/TodoItem](https://testmobileservice.azure-mobile.net/tables/TodoItem \"https://testmobileservice.azure-mobile.net/tables/TodoItem\"). I have inserted a single record already so we can construct a GET call in Fiddler to see what is returned.\nDo this by again, going to the composer tab and inserting the url for the endpoint in the location box and in the Request Headers you will need to add the following:\n> User-Agent: Fiddler     \n> Host: testmobileservice.azure-mobile.net      \n> Accept: application/json      \n> X-ZUMO-APPLICATION: [YOUR APPLICATION KEY HERE]The X-ZUMO-APPLICATION header key/value pair is the secret sauce, I am sure that when the official SDK for these services is released for Windows Phone; there will be some better way to put this all together or maybe not, cause let’s be honest REST is EASY!\nSo Click the Execute button and we get a nice JSON result returned\n> [{\"id\":1,\"ToDoText\":\"Text1\",\"ToDoId\":1}]But wait, can we get XML too? No, it does not appear so.&nbsp; Trying to change the Accept header to “**Accept:application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8**” to get xml does not work. Also it is important note that if the Accept header is not sent, JSON is also returned.&nbsp; \nIt is my assumption that, as you can do in ASP.NET Web API, the services are doing something like \n> HttpConfig.Formatters.Remove(HttpConfig.Formatters.XmlFormatter);in order to force JSON, this is a smaller payload and is the more preferred format for REST based services.\n\n### Inserting /<strike> Updating</strike> Data\nAgain remember that these are simply REST based services, so you can just do the same as above and instead of calling with a GET, do it with a** <strike>PUT</strike> (405 Method Not Allowed)** or POST and pass a payload of type ToDoItem.&nbsp; Here is an example of an insert.\nChange the dropdown in the composer tab of Fiddler from a GET to a POST (INSERT) and in the Request Body add the following text:\n> {&nbsp; \"ToDoText\":\"Text1\" , \"ToDoId\":2}Click the execute button and on the left window you should get a Result of 201 and the response sends back the newly created item in JSON.\n> {\"ToDoText\":\"Text1\",\"ToDoId\":2,\"id\":2}\n**Methods Allowed – GET, POST, DELETE**\n\n### Dynamic Tables\nSo what’s really behind this?&nbsp; Is it SQL Server, a flavor of NoSQL running inside SQL? Is this table storage with some magic?&nbsp; Let’s call a POST method and add some new fields and see what happens here.\nHere is the new JSON payload:\n> {&nbsp; \n>     \"ToDoText\":\"Text1\" ,            \"ToDoId\":3,       \n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"ToDoWhen\": \"12/01/2012\",      \n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"ToDoByWho\" : \"Shayne Boyer\"      \n> }The highlighted rows here we already had in our table before, but I am passing in some new data fields.

So in my case, the RESTful endpoint for the TodoItem table is: <a href=\"https://testmobileservice.azure-mobile.net/tables/TodoItem\" title=\"https://testmobileservice.azure-mobile.net/tables/TodoItem\">https://testmobileservice.azure-mobile.net/tables/TodoItem</a>. I have inserted a single record already so we can construct a GET call in Fiddler to see what is returned. <br />\nDo this by again, going to the composer tab and inserting the url for the endpoint in the location box and in the Request Headers you will need to add the following:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>User-Agent: Fiddler <br />\n  Host: testmobileservice.azure-mobile.net <br />\n  Accept: application/json <br />\n  X-ZUMO-APPLICATION: [YOUR APPLICATION KEY HERE]The X-ZUMO-APPLICATION header key/value pair is the secret sauce, I am sure that when the official SDK for these services is released for Windows Phone; there will be some better way to put this all together or maybe not, cause let’s be honest REST is EASY!\n  So Click the Execute button and we get a nice JSON result returned <br />\n  [{\"id\":1,\"ToDoText\":\"Text1\",\"ToDoId\":1}]But wait, can we get XML too? No, it does not appear so.&nbsp; Trying to change the Accept header to “<strong>Accept:application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,<em>/</em>;q=0.8</strong>” to get xml does not work. Also it is important note that if the Accept header is not sent, JSON is also returned.&nbsp; \n  It is my assumption that, as you can do in ASP.NET Web API, the services are doing something like <br />\n  HttpConfig.Formatters.Remove(HttpConfig.Formatters.XmlFormatter);in order to force JSON, this is a smaller payload and is the more preferred format for REST based services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"insertingstrikeupdatingstrikedata\">Inserting /<strike> Updating</strike> Data</h3>\n\n<p>Again remember that these are simply REST based services, so you can just do the same as above and instead of calling with a GET, do it with a<em>* <strike>PUT</strike> (405 Method Not Allowed)</em>* or POST and pass a payload of type ToDoItem.&nbsp; Here is an example of an insert. <br />\nChange the dropdown in the composer tab of Fiddler from a GET to a POST (INSERT) and in the Request Body add the following text:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>{&nbsp; \"ToDoText\":\"Text1\" , \"ToDoId\":2}Click the execute button and on the left window you should get a Result of 201 and the response sends back the newly created item in JSON.\n  {\"ToDoText\":\"Text1\",\"ToDoId\":2,\"id\":2}\n  <strong>Methods Allowed – GET, POST, DELETE</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"dynamictables\">Dynamic Tables</h3>\n\n<p>So what’s really behind this?&nbsp; Is it SQL Server, a flavor of NoSQL running inside SQL? Is this table storage with some magic?&nbsp; Let’s call a POST method and add some new fields and see what happens here. <br />\nHere is the new JSON payload:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>{&nbsp; \n      \"ToDoText\":\"Text1\" ,            \"ToDoId\":3, <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"ToDoWhen\": \"12/01/2012\", <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"ToDoByWho\" : \"Shayne Boyer\" <br />\n  }The highlighted rows here we already had in our table before, but I am passing in some new data fields. And it works, very cool…\n  <a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-BFiC1Z5I6hc/UEDYBw3Pl-I/AAAAAAAAATc/hWu18CNE7yw/s1600-h/image%25255B43%25255D.png\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ZcwtPqARAT0/UEDYCRBJajI/AAAAAAAAATk/HMcmHGIX8xU/image_thumb%25255B23%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" alt=\"image\" title=\"image\" /></a>\n  What does a get return now that we have the new fields in one but not in the other? <br />\n  <a href=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Y9n_eQzlrPs/UEDYCzCWENI/AAAAAAAAATs/wsS3xD3gteU/s1600-h/image%25255B48%25255D.png\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/-lJluBM1rg-c/UEDYDEo02ZI/AAAAAAAAAT0/xyOld3xetAU/image_thumb%25255B26%25255D.png?imgmax=800\" alt=\"image\" title=\"image\" /></a>\n  I like it!

According to Laurent's blog it is a side by side install with previous versions:> MVVM Light for Windows 8 is a side-by-side install with the standard MVVM Light V3 or V4 beta. Simply download and run the MSI from Codeplex. As usual, the last step of the installation performs a “/setup” of Visual Studio to actualize the project template cache, and unfortunately this last step can last very long. Please be patient and don’t cancel before the end! The installation process is very similar to that described on the MVVM Light installation page (except that there is no NuGet installer for VS11 yet).The following [link](http://geekswithblogs.net/lbugnion/archive/2011/10/03/mvvm-light-toolkit-for-windows-8-preview-mvvmlight-win8.aspx) states the summary of the ported components from the previous versions, but I'll paraphrase here:\n\n*   **ObservableObject** including all ways to raise PropertyChanged.&nbsp;\n*   **ViewModelBase** including all ways to raise PropertyChanged.&nbsp;\n*   **Messenger** including all message types except DialogMessage (see below).&nbsp;\n*   **RelayCommand** with and without parameter.&nbsp;\n*   **SimpleIoc** which might well be the very first IOC container working on Windows 8.&nbsp;Man do I love the SimpleIoc! Makes adding the new views soooo much easier than in the Windows Phone version.There are a few missing components, one of which is EventToCommand, however thanks to a new friend I have made, Joost van Schaik (see his blog here),  there is a solution to that and it's available as a nuget package with some additional behavior features I encourage you to look into but I'll at least cover the EventToCommand features he offers.Getting StartedMVVM Light Project TemplateAfter installing the toolkit you will see that there is a new project template available in the Visual Studio 2012 New Project DialogNoted as \"Windows Metro Style\"Name the project \"MvvmLight_Walkthrough\" and click Ok.The project template is simple, but add some new features that were not in previous versions of the toolkit. In the Solution Explorer you'll notice a Design folder with a class called DesignDataService. This is a great feature; the default template putting in a design data class repository.Second, as in the past version of the toolkit there is the normal ViewModelLocator class, but in this version there is new feature - SimpleIoc, a container class which if you are like me had everything else in a container for DI with the exception of the ViewModels unless you rolled your own.public class ViewModelLocator    {        static ViewModelLocator()        {            ServiceLocator.SetLocatorProvider(() => SimpleIoc.Default);            if (ViewModelBase.IsInDesignModeStatic)            {                SimpleIoc.Default.Register<idataservice, design.designdataservice=\"\">();            }            else            {                SimpleIoc.Default.Register<idataservice, dataservice=\"\">();            }            SimpleIoc.Default.Register<mainviewmodel>();        }        /// <summary>        /// Gets the Main property.        /// </summary>        [System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage(\"Microsoft.Performance\",            \"CA1822:MarkMembersAsStatic\",            Justification = \"This non-static member is needed for data binding purposes.\")]        public MainViewModel Main        {            get            {                return ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance<mainviewmodel>();            }        }        /// <summary>        /// Cleans up all the resources.        /// </summary>        public static void Cleanup()        {        }And last, in the Model folder, Laurent has been kind enough to also include an IDataService interface and DataService class to show in the example how to use the real time and design time data models. These are all wired up in the ViewModelLocator as show above.Now if we simply run the application you should get the following to make sure it's all good to go!Running in the SimulatorAs you may or may not notice, this is not to dis-similar from the previous project template test from the previous version.MainViewModelThe binding of the ViewModel to the View is the same as it was in the previous model and there are no noticeable changes to the ViewModelTemplate.  On thing to note is that all options for RaisePropertyChanged are included in this release where as in the previous version you would have to get the \"Pre-release\" version from nuget in order to use them. For example, the built in template puts in the following:/// <summary>        /// The <see cref=\"WelcomeTitle\"> property's name.        /// </see></summary>        public const string WelcomeTitlePropertyName = \"WelcomeTitle\";        private string _welcomeTitle = string.Empty;        /// <summary>        /// Gets the WelcomeTitle property.        /// Changes to that property's value raise the PropertyChanged event.        /// </summary>        public string WelcomeTitle        {            get            {                return _welcomeTitle;            }            set            {                if (_welcomeTitle == value)                {                    return;                }                _welcomeTitle = value;                RaisePropertyChanged(WelcomeTitlePropertyName);            }        }Noticeably where RaisePropertyChanged is using a string value, one of the options now available in the release is to remove the  WelcomeTitlePropertyName variable and then changeRaisePropertyChanged(WelcomeTitlePropertyName);to RaisePropertyChanged(() => WelcomeTitle);</mainviewmodel></mainviewmodel></idataservice,></idataservice,>The other nice benefit here is that the template has also put in the wiring for injecting the IDataService into the constructor for the ViewModel.  Some of these little thing we developers either take for granted that someone has gone through the trouble of putting the plumbing in there or call it the boring work that has to be done before we get the real work done.  You can easily put other dependencies in the constructor here and then just add the mappings in the constructor of the ViewModelLocator by simply registering the types with the SimpleIoc container.public MainViewModel(IDataService dataService)        {            _dataService = dataService;            _dataService.GetData(                (item, error) =>                {                    if (error != null)                    {                        // Report error here                        return;                    }                    WelcomeTitle = item.Title;                });        }Now What?.A simple example here is to add some content to the MainPage and see how we navigate to a second view.  I won't bore you with the details of adding in the controls to the page but here's what the page should look like when you're done. <table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hrp5PMvm5nQ/UDaCqHSTddI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/1n2u7lzJEC8/s400/post+controls.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hrp5PMvm5nQ/UDaCqHSTddI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/1n2u7lzJEC8/s1600/post+controls.png)</td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Added a little MvvmLight color for fun</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n#### EventToCommand\nNow lets just add a prompt to the submit button. But wait, what where's my EventToCommand???  Sure with the button there is a Command property and you can set that to an ICommand in the ViewModel and everything is happy.  But, there are plenty of controls, both baked into WinRT and third party controls that do not have that property. So, for simplicity sake I'm using this control and will get the EventToCommand back in your toolbox, or your Joostbox I should say.\n\n#### Off to Nuget!\nI had this issue where I was looking for the behaviors when porting an app I was working on and could find the dang behaviors in Blend so I went to nuget and did some searching and there wasn't anything that was shaking my fancy. Then I came across Joost van Schaik (see his blog here) and his WinRTBehaviors library and just so happens I hit him in the middle of uploading the nuget package for Win8nl.Now this is a package of Behaviors that was originally a Windows Phone 7 library and It's now growing in its own direction and now contains some Windows 8 specific stuff (according to nuget). So let's get it installed real quick.Install the package by typing the following into the Nuget Package Manager Console or searching for Win8nl in the package explorer.> `PM&gt; Install-Package Win8nl`It will add the library and the necessary dependencies to the project, which include WinRTBehaviors. For more information on the other behaviors there check out Joost's blog.Adding EventToCommand First, lets add the references to the XAML page:<pre class=\"brush: xml\">xmlns:WinRtBehaviors=\"using:WinRtBehaviors\"\n\nxmlns:Win8nl_Behavior=\"using:Win8nl.Behaviors\"\n</pre>Next, locate the button control and add the following inside the button XAML:            <button x:name=\"btnSubmit\" content=\"Submit\"  =\"\"   =\"\" fontfamily=\"{StaticResource MyFont}\" fontsize=\"{StaticResource MyFontSize}\" horizontalalignment=\"Center\" margin=\"0,20,0,0\">                <winrtbehaviors:interaction.behaviors>                    <win8nl_behavior:eventtocommandbehavior event=\"Tapped\"  =\"\" command=\"AreYouSureCommand\"   =\"\" commandparameter=\"{Binding MyName}\">                </win8nl_behavior:eventtocommandbehavior></winrtbehaviors:interaction.behaviors>            </button>Now, open the MainViewModel.cs code and we can add the command for the new behavior here when the button is tapped.As usual the Command property is expecting an ICommand, add the following code to the MainViewModel and return a new instance of RelayCommand to execute whatever behavior you wish.  In this example, I'm just doing a little popup to show whatever the user input into the myName TextBox.public ICommand AreYouSureCommand        {            get            {                return new RelayCommand<string>((p) =>                {                    var msg = new MessageDialog(string.Format(\"Hi there {0}\", p));                                       msg.ShowAsync();                });            }        }See the result here:And that is EventToCommand for MVVMlight for Windows 8!There are many more behaviors in the WinRTBehaviors library that you should take advantage of, for me the most notable ones being FlipViewPanoramaBehavior and NavigationService being ported to Windows 8\\. </string>","html":"<p>Now that Windows 8 and Visual Studio are in RTM I wanted to put together a quick entry for those Windows Phone developers making the transition to Windows 8 development with their MVVM Light skills.</p>\n\n<p>Laurent Bugnion, is the creator of the MVVM Light toolkit and I, as well as many others, have been using this for Windows Phone development for a while now. &nbsp;I am porting on of my applications to Windows 8 and wanted to take the knowledge of this toolkit to the new platform hoping that there were either some new enhancements and/or not many changes so that I could just go. &nbsp;Well that was the deal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mvvmlighttoolkitforwindows8rtm\">MVVM Light Toolkit for Windows 8 RTM</h3>\n\n<p>The latest installer for the toolkit, \"MVVM Light Toolkit V4 RTM\", is available from CodePlex. According to Laurent's blog it is a side by side install with previous versions:> MVVM Light for Windows 8 is a side-by-side install with the standard MVVM Light V3 or V4 beta. Simply download and run the MSI from Codeplex. As usual, the last step of the installation performs a “/setup” of Visual Studio to actualize the project template cache, and unfortunately this last step can last very long. Please be patient and don’t cancel before the end! The installation process is very similar to that described on the MVVM Light installation page (except that there is no NuGet installer for VS11 yet).The following <a href=\"http://geekswithblogs.net/lbugnion/archive/2011/10/03/mvvm-light-toolkit-for-windows-8-preview-mvvmlight-win8.aspx\">link</a> states the summary of the ported components from the previous versions, but I'll paraphrase here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ObservableObject</strong> including all ways to raise PropertyChanged.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>ViewModelBase</strong> including all ways to raise PropertyChanged.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Messenger</strong> including all message types except DialogMessage (see below).&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>RelayCommand</strong> with and without parameter.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>SimpleIoc</strong> which might well be the very first IOC container working on Windows 8.&nbsp;Man do I love the SimpleIoc! Makes adding the new views soooo much easier than in the Windows Phone version.There are a few missing components, one of which is EventToCommand, however thanks to a new friend I have made, Joost van Schaik (see his blog here),  there is a solution to that and it's available as a nuget package with some additional behavior features I encourage you to look into but I'll at least cover the EventToCommand features he offers.Getting StartedMVVM Light Project TemplateAfter installing the toolkit you will see that there is a new project template available in the Visual Studio 2012 New Project DialogNoted as \"Windows Metro Style\"Name the project \"MvvmLight<em>Walkthrough\" and click Ok.The project template is simple, but add some new features that were not in previous versions of the toolkit. In the Solution Explorer you'll notice a Design folder with a class called DesignDataService. This is a great feature; the default template putting in a design data class repository.Second, as in the past version of the toolkit there is the normal ViewModelLocator class, but in this version there is new feature - SimpleIoc, a container class which if you are like me had everything else in a container for DI with the exception of the ViewModels unless you rolled your own.public class ViewModelLocator    {        static ViewModelLocator()        {            ServiceLocator.SetLocatorProvider(() => SimpleIoc.Default);            if (ViewModelBase.IsInDesignModeStatic)            {                SimpleIoc.Default.Register<idataservice, design.designdataservice=\"\">();            }            else            {                SimpleIoc.Default.Register<idataservice, dataservice=\"\">();            }            SimpleIoc.Default.Register<mainviewmodel>();        }        /// <summary>        /// Gets the Main property.        /// </summary>        [System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage(\"Microsoft.Performance\",            \"CA1822:MarkMembersAsStatic\",            Justification = \"This non-static member is needed for data binding purposes.\")]        public MainViewModel Main        {            get            {                return ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance<mainviewmodel>();            }        }        /// <summary>        /// Cleans up all the resources.        /// </summary>        public static void Cleanup()        {        }And last, in the Model folder, Laurent has been kind enough to also include an IDataService interface and DataService class to show in the example how to use the real time and design time data models. These are all wired up in the ViewModelLocator as show above.Now if we simply run the application you should get the following to make sure it's all good to go!Running in the SimulatorAs you may or may not notice, this is not to dis-similar from the previous project template test from the previous version.MainViewModelThe binding of the ViewModel to the View is the same as it was in the previous model and there are no noticeable changes to the ViewModelTemplate.  On thing to note is that all options for RaisePropertyChanged are included in this release where as in the previous version you would have to get the \"Pre-release\" version from nuget in order to use them. For example, the built in template puts in the following:/// <summary>        /// The <see cref=\"WelcomeTitle\"> property's name.        /// </see></summary>        public const string WelcomeTitlePropertyName = \"WelcomeTitle\";        private string _welcomeTitle = string.Empty;        /// <summary>        /// Gets the WelcomeTitle property.        /// Changes to that property's value raise the PropertyChanged event.        /// </summary>        public string WelcomeTitle        {            get            {                return _welcomeTitle;            }            set            {                if (</em>welcomeTitle == value)                {                    return;                }                _welcomeTitle = value;                RaisePropertyChanged(WelcomeTitlePropertyName);            }        }Noticeably where RaisePropertyChanged is using a string value, one of the options now available in the release is to remove the  WelcomeTitlePropertyName variable and then changeRaisePropertyChanged(WelcomeTitlePropertyName);to RaisePropertyChanged(() => WelcomeTitle);</mainviewmodel></mainviewmodel></idataservice,></idataservice,>The other nice benefit here is that the template has also put in the wiring for injecting the IDataService into the constructor for the ViewModel.  Some of these little thing we developers either take for granted that someone has gone through the trouble of putting the plumbing in there or call it the boring work that has to be done before we get the real work done.  You can easily put other dependencies in the constructor here and then just add the mappings in the constructor of the ViewModelLocator by simply registering the types with the SimpleIoc container.public MainViewModel(IDataService dataService)        {            _dataService = dataService;            _dataService.GetData(                (item, error) =>                {                    if (error != null)                    {                        // Report error here                        return;                    }                    WelcomeTitle = item.Title;                });        }Now What?.A simple example here is to add some content to the MainPage and see how we navigate to a second view.  I won't bore you with the details of adding in the controls to the page but here's what the page should look like when you're done. <table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hrp5PMvm5nQ/UDaCqHSTddI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/1n2u7lzJEC8/s1600/post+controls.png\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hrp5PMvm5nQ/UDaCqHSTddI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/1n2u7lzJEC8/s400/post+controls.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Added a little MvvmLight color for fun</td></tr></tbody></table></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"eventtocommand\">EventToCommand</h4>\n\n<p>Now lets just add a prompt to the submit button. But wait, what where's my EventToCommand???  Sure with the button there is a Command property and you can set that to an ICommand in the ViewModel and everything is happy.  But, there are plenty of controls, both baked into WinRT and third party controls that do not have that property. So, for simplicity sake I'm using this control and will get the EventToCommand back in your toolbox, or your Joostbox I should say.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"offtonuget\">Off to Nuget!</h4>\n\n<p>I had this issue where I was looking for the behaviors when porting an app I was working on and could find the dang behaviors in Blend so I went to nuget and did some searching and there wasn't anything that was shaking my fancy. Then I came across Joost van Schaik (see his blog here) and his WinRTBehaviors library and just so happens I hit him in the middle of uploading the nuget package for Win8nl.Now this is a package of Behaviors that was originally a Windows Phone 7 library and It's now growing in its own direction and now contains some Windows 8 specific stuff (according to nuget).

Start by adding a new folder to the solution called “**Messages**”.\n\nThen add a new class called **NavigateToPageMessage.cs **which contains the following code.\n\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp; highlight: ;\">public class NavigateToPageMessage\n{\n\tpublic NavigateToPageMessage()\n\t{\n\n\t}\n\n\tpublic string PageName { get; set; }\n}</pre>\nNow we have to register the main page of the application to receive the NavigateToPageMessage and do something once it receives it. Open MainPage.xaml and add a new event handler for the Loaded Event.       Do this by selecting the **PhoneApplicationPage** in the Document Outline Window, go to the Properties Windows and select the Events Tab and double click the **_Loaded_** event to insert the code.\n\n&nbsp;      [![image](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-p3vDgVEggUo/UBqmOLVg_dI/AAAAAAAAAKU/jqXL5vb9VZ4/image_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \"image\")](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-i4rq_yd6g1Y/UBqmNhHy0YI/AAAAAAAAAKM/S5bslzGxNRw/s1600-h/image%25255B3%25255D.png)\n\n&nbsp;Open the MainPage.xaml.cs code and find the newly inserted event handler which should look like the following:    \n\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp; highlight: ;\">private void PhoneApplicationPage_Loaded(object sender, System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n\n}\n</pre>\nIn order to support messaging from MVVM Light, add the messaging namespace (MvvmLight1.Messages;) to the top of the page.      Next, we will add the code to subscribe to the **NavigateToPageMessage.**   \n\n**\n**\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp; highlight: ;\">private void PhoneApplicationPage_Loaded(object sender, System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n\tMessenger.Default.Register&lt;NavigateToPageMessage&gt;\n\t\t\t\t(\n\t\t\t\t\tthis,\n\t\t\t\t\t(action) =&gt; ReceiveMessage(action)\n\t\t\t\t);\n}\n</pre>\nReceiveMessage is the delegate that will handle the message object, in this case the NavigateToPageMessage type.     \n\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp; highlight: ;\">private object ReceiveMessage(NavigateToPageMessage action)\n{\n\tvar page = string.Format(\"/Views/{0}View.xaml\", action.PageName);\n\n\tif (action.PageName == \"Main\")\n\t{\n\t\tpage = \"/MainPage.xaml\";\n\t}\n\n\tNavigationService.Navigate(\n\t   new System.Uri(page,\n\t\t\t System.UriKind.Relative));\n\treturn null;\n}\n</pre>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n\n.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre\n{\n\tfont-size: small;\n\tcolor: black;\n\tfont-family: consolas, \"Courier New\", courier, monospace;\n\tbackground-color: #ffffff;\n\t/*white-space: pre;*/\n}\n.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }\n.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }\n.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }\n.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }\n.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }\n.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }\n.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }\n.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }\n.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }\n.csharpcode .alt \n{\n\tbackground-color: #f4f4f4;\n\twidth: 100%;\n\tmargin: 0em;\n}\n.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style>   What we have done here is handled the property **PageName** of the action and to the application to navigate to the appropriate page. Pretty simple right?&nbsp; You’ll notice that I put in a special handler here if the PageName is Main to follow the default structure in the MVVM Light template.&nbsp; As a note, I typically move the MainPage into the Views folder and make the adjustments to all of the wiring so that all of my views are in the place where I like them.&nbsp; Next step is to hook up that button we added earlier to send the **NavigateToPageMessage **when its clicked.      If you have Blend, this portion is drag and drop, otherwise you’ll have to some cut and paste.       Open the project in Blend, then open MainPage.xaml in the designer. Select the Assets Tab and click on the Behaviors in the left panel.&nbsp; You will see a selection called **EventToCommand; **click and drag this item to either the Button on the design surface OR the button in the Object and Timeline and release.\n\n&nbsp;      [![image](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-aavJ5KeD5Rg/UBrKQhivdNI/AAAAAAAAAKo/10HUg1Lo1aU/image_thumb%25255B4%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \"image\")](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-S9KFShwvJy8/UBrKQH3ZYnI/AAAAAAAAAKk/l7v8BxOvM2s/s1600-h/image%25255B8%25255D.png)\n\n&nbsp;Then in the properties tab give the new EventToCommand the name “GoToPage2”, the EventName should already set to _Click_, if it is not change it.\n\n&nbsp;     [![image](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-A1RKfvPXqww/UBrKRa4gpkI/AAAAAAAAAK8/EviA1vLNclI/image_thumb%25255B7%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \"image\")](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-nMXvBu7YfA4/UBrKQzj-h8I/AAAAAAAAAK0/4LGuar3KiN0/s1600-h/image%25255B13%25255D.png)\n\n&nbsp;Save your changes, and if you view the xaml now you should see the following code    \n\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; highlight: ;\">&lt;Button Content=\"Button\" Height=\"72\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Left\" Margin=\"154,354,0,0\" x:Name=\"button1\" VerticalAlignment=\"Top\" Width=\"160\" &gt;\n\t&lt;i:Interaction.Triggers&gt;\n\t\t&lt;i:EventTrigger EventName=\"Click\"&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;GalaSoft_MvvmLight_Command:EventToCommand x:Name=\"GoToPage2\" Command=\"{Binding GoToSecondPageCommand, Mode=OneWay}\"/&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/i:EventTrigger&gt;\n\t&lt;/i:Interaction.Triggers&gt;\n&lt;/Button&gt;\n</pre>\nNext step, back to Visual Studio to add the last bit of code to the MainViewModel.&nbsp; Add a new RelayCommand which is in the MvvmLight.Command namespace.    \n\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp; highlight: ;\"></pre><pre class=\"brush: csharp; highlight: ;\">public RelayCommand GoToSecondPageCommand\n{\n\tget;\n\tprivate set;\n}\n</pre>\nThen in the constructor in the “else” portion you need to instantiate the RelayCommand and add the handler to send the message.

So I am writing this post to help you know just where to start and what tools are available to help you be successful in a hurry.\n> Step 1: Download and install the necessary SDK, SDK update and Silverlight tool kit for Windows Phone development.\n> WP7 SDK 7.1: [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=27570&nbsp;](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=27570)\n> WP7 SDK 7.1.1 Update: [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29233](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29233)\n> Silverlight for Windows Phone Toolkit: [&nbsp;http://silverlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/75888](http://silverlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/75888)\n> Step 2: Bookmark or favorite the following sites for resources, code samples, tutorials, templates, icons and many other things to help you get started and continue developing.&nbsp;_> [_...Read more_](http://richarddunbar.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/how-to-get-started-with-windows-phone.html)\nIn Orlando on the 10th of August, he is hosting an event that covers a lot if not all of the post step by step. &nbsp;Sign up here if you're in that area:&nbsp;Nokia Meetup - Orlando, FL | Aug 10, 2012 - Meetup [http://bit.ly/NHchzF](http://bit.ly/NHchzF)&nbsp;.\n\nWhat I wanted to do with this post is give you what I think is another need to know when developing Windows Phone Applications and that's the MVVM design pattern using [MVVM Light](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/)&nbsp;by&nbsp;Laurent Bugnion. So, here goes.\n\nThere are a few other MVVM Frameworks available, but this by far is my favorite and in fact was also used by Amazon in their Kindle for Windows Phone application.\n\nStart by going [here](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/) and installing the latest version, this will install the templates within Visual Studio and what you'll need to complete the steps in this walk through as well as future applications I look forward to seeing.\n\n###        Creating the Application\n\nOpen Visual Studio (I'm using 2010 for this), select New Project and in the Installed Templates you'll see MVVMLight(WP71).\n\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\">[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-24_Pe0F4OCI/UAbCOvZ8rCI/AAAAAAAAAGk/fBLmBOl3b88/s400/7-18-2012+9-58-40+AM.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-24_Pe0F4OCI/UAbCOvZ8rCI/AAAAAAAAAGk/fBLmBOl3b88/s1600/7-18-2012+9-58-40+AM.png)</td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">You'll notice that MVVM Light supports WP7 and WP7.1, it also supports Windows 8 too!</td></tr></tbody></table>I left the name of the project **_MVVMLight1_** just for example purposes. &nbsp;Go ahead and click **OK **and create the project. Before we write an additional code let's just hit F5 and make sure that the project compiles and the \"test\" initial page fires up. &nbsp;This ensures that the template / framework and all of the pieces and parts of MVVM Light are operational. &nbsp;If so, you should see the following:\n\n###        Connecting the View and the View-Model\n\nFirst let's look at the View. Open **MainPage.xaml**, and take a look at line 17\\. &nbsp;The most important piece of MVVM is setting the DataContext of the View. &nbsp;This allows the View to know where to look for its data or bindings.\n\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; highlight: [17];\" style=\"width: 500 px;\">&lt;phone:PhoneApplicationPage x:Class=\"MvvmLight1.MainPage\"\n                            xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n                            xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n                            xmlns:phone=\"clr-namespace:Microsoft.Phone.Controls;assembly=Microsoft.Phone\"\n                            xmlns:shell=\"clr-namespace:Microsoft.Phone.Shell;assembly=Microsoft.Phone\"\n                            xmlns:d=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008\"\n                            xmlns:mc=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006\"\n                            FontFamily=\"{StaticResource PhoneFontFamilyNormal}\"\n                            FontSize=\"{StaticResource PhoneFontSizeNormal}\"\n                            Foreground=\"{StaticResource PhoneForegroundBrush}\"\n                            SupportedOrientations=\"Portrait\"\n                            Orientation=\"Portrait\"\n                            mc:Ignorable=\"d\"\n                            d:DesignWidth=\"480\"\n                            d:DesignHeight=\"768\"\n                            shell:SystemTray.IsVisible=\"True\"\n                            DataContext=\"{Binding Main, Source={StaticResource Locator}}\"&gt;</pre>\nYou'll notice that instead of binding to an object directly, the DataContext is set to a StaticResource Property called **_Main _**within _Locator_. We'll put that aside for now until we cover the rest of the information here in the view.\n\nNext, if you move down to line 32, you'll see where the view is binding to properties in the View-Model.\n\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; highlight: [5,8,16];\">&lt;StackPanel x:Name=\"TitlePanel\"\n            Grid.Row=\"0\"\n            Margin=\"24,24,0,12\"&gt;\n    &lt;TextBlock x:Name=\"ApplicationTitle\"\n               Text=\"{Binding ApplicationTitle}\"\n               Style=\"{StaticResource PhoneTextNormalStyle}\" /&gt;\n    &lt;TextBlock x:Name=\"PageTitle\"\n               Text=\"{Binding PageName}\"\n               Margin=\"-3,-8,0,0\"\n               Style=\"{StaticResource PhoneTextTitle1Style}\" /&gt;\n&lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n\n&lt;Grid x:Name=\"ContentGrid\"\n      Grid.Row=\"1\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;TextBlock Text=\"{Binding Welcome}\"\n               Style=\"{StaticResource PhoneTextNormalStyle}\"\n               HorizontalAlignment=\"Center\"\n               VerticalAlignment=\"Center\"\n               FontSize=\"40\" /&gt;\n&lt;/Grid&gt;</pre>\nBy setting the **Text**&nbsp;property equal to {Binding Welcome} for example it is telling the view to get the value from the View-Model which is subsequently set in the DataContext of the View as stated above. So in looking at ViewModel/MainViewModel.cs in the solution explorer you'll see that that value is set to_&nbsp;\"Welcome to MVVM Light\"_.\n\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp; highlight: [5];\">public string Welcome\n        {\n            get\n            {\n                return \"Welcome to MVVM Light\";\n            }\n        }\n</pre>\n\n###        ViewModelLocator\nOk, so back to the ViewModelLocator. This class is the air traffic controller, if you will, of linking up your views with the view models, well that's how I look at it anyway.  It's responsible for creating and disposing of all of your View-Models, and although it is not the only way to do this; it is the way MVVM Light does it.One thing that I'll state is that other than adding additional views, I almost never touch the ViewModelLocator code, it's thoughtless when it comes to the core app development.\nThe application sets a resource in App.xaml as shown below: <application.resources>     <vm:viewmodellocator x:key=\"Locator\" d:isdatasource=\"True\"> </vm:viewmodellocator></application.resources>Seems pretty cut and dry. BUT where a majority of the examples I have seen concerning MVVM Light stop is right here. Other that some specific how to do this or that, I think they fall short for the beginner.  So, the next step is adding an additional page. So let's move on...     Adding a Second PageFor the sake of organization and keeping a little sanity when getting into large applications let's add a new folder called \"View\".  Next, right click and select Add -> New Item. You'll see now that within the Add Item Dialog you have a few options for MVVM Light as well as the traditional add items.Select MvvmView (WP7) and name it SecondPageView.xaml and click ok.  You'll notice that the structure, DataContext, etc is exactly the same of MainPage.xaml, essentially it's a template and easy to change.Next, we will add a new View-Model. So, right click the ViewModel folder and select Add->New Item->MvvmViewModel (WP7), name the View-Model \"SecondPageViewModel.cs\" and click Add.In order to wire up the new View and View-Model we must open up the ViewModelLocator.cs class and take advantage of the snippets that MVVM Light gives us to do so and then do a little clean up.Go to just above the constructor and type in the following and hit enter -> _mvvmlocatorproperty_What this snippet does is add the following items to the class.<pre class=\"brush: csharp\">private static ViewModelType _viewModelPropertyName;\n\n        /// <summary>\n        /// Gets the ViewModelPropertyName property.\n        /// </summary>\n        public static ViewModelType ViewModelPropertyNameStatic\n        {\n            get\n            {\n                if (_viewModelPropertyName == null)\n                {\n                    CreateViewModelPropertyName();\n                }\n\n                return _viewModelPropertyName;\n            }\n        }\n</pre>\nNow the snippet will highlight the **ViewModelType **identifier first and you will want to change this to **SecondPageViewModel**, then hit tab. Second, change the **_viewModelPropetyName **to **_viewModelSecondPage **and hit tab. Finally, you will be navigated to the comment portion for the **ViewModelPropertyName **and change this to **SecondPageViewModel**.  When you are done it should look like this... \n\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp\">private static SecondPageViewModel _viewModelSecondPage;\n\n        /// <summary>\n        /// Gets the ViewModelSecondPage property.\n        /// </summary>\n        public static SecondPageViewModel ViewModelSecondPageStatic\n        {\n            get\n            {\n                if (_viewModelSecondPage == null)       \n                {\n                    CreateViewModelSecondPage();\n                }\n\n                return _viewModelSecondPage;\n            }\n        }\n</pre>\nOk, now a little work to do to make this addition complete. &nbsp;Need to add \"&nbsp;CreateViewModelSecondPage();\" to the constructor just under \"CreateMain();\". &nbsp;This ensures that the instance of the new View-Model is created.\n\nNext, one draw back is that the snippet creates a duplicate of \"Cleanup()\", so if you get the following error:\n\n> Type 'MvvmLight1.ViewModel.ViewModelLocator' already defines a member called 'Cleanup' with the same parameter typesYou'll need to also move the contents of the duplicated method to the existing Cleanup method. In our case, the contents are \" ClearViewModelSecondPage();\".Last step, go to the SecondPageView.xaml and change the value in the DataContext to the new ViewModel.from:DataContext=\"{Binding ViewModelName, Source={StaticResource Locator}}\">to:DataContext=\"{Binding SecondPageViewModel, Source={StaticResource Locator}}\">Part 2 we'll see how to add a button on the first page to navigate to the second page which will cover navigation and messaging.

So I am writing this post to help you know just where to start and what tools are available to help you be successful in a hurry.\n  Step 1: Download and install the necessary SDK, SDK update and Silverlight tool kit for Windows Phone development.\n  WP7 SDK 7.1: <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=27570\">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=27570&nbsp;</a>\n  WP7 SDK 7.1.1 Update: <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29233\">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29233</a>\n  Silverlight for Windows Phone Toolkit: <a href=\"http://silverlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/75888\">&nbsp;<a href='http://silverlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/75888'>http://silverlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/75888</a></a>\n  Step 2: Bookmark or favorite the following sites for resources, code samples, tutorials, templates, icons and many other things to help you get started and continue developing.&nbsp;</em>> <a href=\"http://richarddunbar.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/how-to-get-started-with-windows-phone.html\"><em>...Read more</em></a>\n  In Orlando on the 10th of August, he is hosting an event that covers a lot if not all of the post step by step. &nbsp;Sign up here if you're in that area:&nbsp;Nokia Meetup - Orlando, FL | Aug 10, 2012 - Meetup <a href=\"http://bit.ly/NHchzF\">http://bit.ly/NHchzF</a>&nbsp;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I wanted to do with this post is give you what I think is another need to know when developing Windows Phone Applications and that's the MVVM design pattern using <a href=\"http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/\">MVVM Light</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;Laurent Bugnion. So, here goes.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few other MVVM Frameworks available, but this by far is my favorite and in fact was also used by Amazon in their Kindle for Windows Phone application.</p>\n\n<p>Start by going <a href=\"http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/\">here</a> and installing the latest version, this will install the templates within Visual Studio and what you'll need to complete the steps in this walk through as well as future applications I look forward to seeing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"creatingtheapplication\">Creating the Application</h3>\n\n<p>Open Visual Studio (I'm using 2010 for this), select New Project and in the Installed Templates you'll see MVVMLight(WP71).</p>\n\n<p><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-24_Pe0F4OCI/UAbCOvZ8rCI/AAAAAAAAAGk/fBLmBOl3b88/s1600/7-18-2012+9-58-40+AM.png\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-24_Pe0F4OCI/UAbCOvZ8rCI/AAAAAAAAAGk/fBLmBOl3b88/s400/7-18-2012+9-58-40+AM.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">You'll notice that MVVM Light supports WP7 and WP7.1, it also supports Windows 8 too!</td></tr></tbody></table>I left the name of the project <strong><em>MVVMLight1</em></strong> just for example purposes. &nbsp;Go ahead and click <em>*OK *</em>and create the project. Before we write an additional code let's just hit F5 and make sure that the project compiles and the \"test\" initial page fires up. &nbsp;This ensures that the template / framework and all of the pieces and parts of MVVM Light are operational. &nbsp;If so, you should see the following:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"connectingtheviewandtheviewmodel\">Connecting the View and the View-Model</h3>\n\n<p>First let's look at the View. Open <strong>MainPage.xaml</strong>, and take a look at line 17. &nbsp;The most important piece of MVVM is setting the DataContext of the View. &nbsp;This allows the View to know where to look for its data or bindings.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; highlight: [17];\" style=\"width: 500 px;\">&lt;phone:PhoneApplicationPage x:Class=\"MvvmLight1.MainPage\"  \n                            xmlns=\"<a href='http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation'>http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation</a>\"\n                            xmlns:x=\"<a href='http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml'>http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml</a>\"\n                            xmlns:phone=\"clr-namespace:Microsoft.Phone.Controls;assembly=Microsoft.Phone\"\n                            xmlns:shell=\"clr-namespace:Microsoft.Phone.Shell;assembly=Microsoft.Phone\"\n                            xmlns:d=\"<a href='http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008'>http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008</a>\"\n                            xmlns:mc=\"<a href='http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006'>http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006</a>\"\n                            FontFamily=\"{StaticResource PhoneFontFamilyNormal}\"\n                            FontSize=\"{StaticResource PhoneFontSizeNormal}\"\n                            Foreground=\"{StaticResource PhoneForegroundBrush}\"\n                            SupportedOrientations=\"Portrait\"\n                            Orientation=\"Portrait\"\n                            mc:Ignorable=\"d\"\n                            d:DesignWidth=\"480\"\n                            d:DesignHeight=\"768\"\n                            shell:SystemTray.IsVisible=\"True\"\n                            DataContext=\"{Binding Main, Source={StaticResource Locator}}\"&gt;</pre>\nYou'll notice that instead of binding to an object directly, the DataContext is set to a StaticResource Property called **_Main _**within _Locator_. We'll put that aside for now until we cover the rest of the information here in the view.\n\nNext, if you move down to line 32, you'll see where the view is binding to properties in the View-Model.\n\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; highlight: [5,8,16];\">&lt;StackPanel x:Name=\"TitlePanel\"  \n            Grid.Row=\"0\"\n            Margin=\"24,24,0,12\"&gt;\n    &lt;TextBlock x:Name=\"ApplicationTitle\"\n               Text=\"{Binding ApplicationTitle}\"\n               Style=\"{StaticResource PhoneTextNormalStyle}\" /&gt;\n    &lt;TextBlock x:Name=\"PageTitle\"\n               Text=\"{Binding PageName}\"\n               Margin=\"-3,-8,0,0\"\n               Style=\"{StaticResource PhoneTextTitle1Style}\" /&gt;\n&lt;/StackPanel&gt;\n\n&lt;Grid x:Name=\"ContentGrid\"\n      Grid.Row=\"1\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;TextBlock Text=\"{Binding Welcome}\"\n               Style=\"{StaticResource PhoneTextNormalStyle}\"\n               HorizontalAlignment=\"Center\"\n               VerticalAlignment=\"Center\"\n               FontSize=\"40\" /&gt;\n&lt;/Grid&gt;</pre>\nBy setting the **Text**&nbsp;property equal to {Binding Welcome} for example it is telling the view to get the value from the View-Model which is subsequently set in the DataContext of the View as stated above. So in looking at ViewModel/MainViewModel.cs in the solution explorer you'll see that that value is set to_&nbsp;\"Welcome to MVVM Light\"_.\n\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp; highlight: [5];\">public string Welcome  \n        {\n            get\n            {\n                return \"Welcome to MVVM Light\";\n            }\n        }\n</pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"viewmodellocator\">ViewModelLocator</h3>\n\n<p>Ok, so back to the ViewModelLocator. This class is the air traffic controller, if you will, of linking up your views with the view models, well that's how I look at it anyway.  It's responsible for creating and disposing of all of your View-Models, and although it is not the only way to do this; it is the way MVVM Light does it.One thing that I'll state is that other than adding additional views, I almost never touch the ViewModelLocator code, it's thoughtless when it comes to the core app development. <br />\nThe application sets a resource in App.xaml as shown below: <application.resources>     <vm:viewmodellocator x:key=\"Locator\" d:isdatasource=\"True\"> </vm:viewmodellocator></application.resources>Seems pretty cut and dry. BUT where a majority of the examples I have seen concerning MVVM Light stop is right here. Other that some specific how to do this or that, I think they fall short for the beginner.  So, the next step is adding an additional page. So let's move on...     Adding a Second PageFor the sake of organization and keeping a little sanity when getting into large applications let's add a new folder called \"View\".  Next, right click and select Add -> New Item. You'll see now that within the Add Item Dialog you have a few options for MVVM Light as well as the traditional add items.Select MvvmView (WP7) and name it SecondPageView.xaml and click ok.  You'll notice that the structure, DataContext, etc is exactly the same of MainPage.xaml, essentially it's a template and easy to change.Next, we will add a new View-Model. So, right click the ViewModel folder and select Add->New Item->MvvmViewModel (WP7), name the View-Model \"SecondPageViewModel.cs\" and click Add.In order to wire up the new View and View-Model we must open up the ViewModelLocator.cs class and take advantage of the snippets that MVVM Light gives us to do so and then do a little clean up.Go to just above the constructor and type in the following and hit enter -> <em>mvvmlocatorproperty</em>What this snippet does is add the following items to the class.<pre class=\"brush: csharp\">private static ViewModelType _viewModelPropertyName;</p>\n\n<pre><code>    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// Gets the ViewModelPropertyName property.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    public static ViewModelType ViewModelPropertyNameStatic\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            if (_viewModelPropertyName == null)\n            {\n                CreateViewModelPropertyName();\n            }\n\n            return _viewModelPropertyName;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></pre> <br />\nNow the snippet will highlight the <strong>ViewModelType <em>*identifier first and you will want to change this to *</em>SecondPageViewModel</strong>, then hit tab. Second, change the <strong><em>viewModelPropetyName **to **</em>viewModelSecondPage <em>*and hit tab. Finally, you will be navigated to the comment portion for the *</em>ViewModelPropertyName <em>*and change this to *</em>SecondPageViewModel</strong>.  When you are done it should look like this... </p>\n\n<pre class=\"brush: csharp\">private static SecondPageViewModel _viewModelSecondPage;\n\n        /// <summary>\n        /// Gets the ViewModelSecondPage property.\n        /// </summary>\n        public static SecondPageViewModel ViewModelSecondPageStatic\n        {\n            get\n            {\n                if (_viewModelSecondPage == null)       \n                {\n                    CreateViewModelSecondPage();\n                }\n\n                return _viewModelSecondPage;\n            }\n        }\n</pre>  \n\n<p>Ok, now a little work to do to make this addition complete. &nbsp;Need to add \"&nbsp;CreateViewModelSecondPage();\" to the constructor just under \"CreateMain();\". &nbsp;This ensures that the instance of the new View-Model is created.</p>\n\n<p>Next, one draw back is that the snippet creates a duplicate of \"Cleanup()\", so if you get the following error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Type 'MvvmLight1.ViewModel.ViewModelLocator' already defines a member called 'Cleanup' with the same parameter typesYou'll need to also move the contents of the duplicated method to the existing Cleanup method. In our case, the contents are \" ClearViewModelSecondPage();\".Last step, go to the SecondPageView.xaml and change the value in the DataContext to the new ViewModel.from:DataContext=\"{Binding ViewModelName, Source={StaticResource Locator}}\">to:DataContext=\"{Binding SecondPageViewModel, Source={StaticResource Locator}}\">Part 2 we'll see how to add a button on the first page to navigate to the second page which will cover navigation and messaging.

What that means is now when you makes changes to your code, there is no need to re-compile to see the changes in the browser.\n\n<div style=\"float:right; height:200px;width:200px;\">\n![picard kmon](/content/images/2014/12/kmon.jpg)\n</div>\n\n>Visual Studio uses the Roslyn compiler to enable this dynamic compilation. You still have all of the structure and power of a compiled framework, but the development experience feels more like an interpreted language. See more here - [ASP.NET 5 Overview](http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/aspnet-vnext/aspnet-5-overview)\n\nThis is a great new feature for Visual Studio users, but the new awesome is you now have a choice of what IDE you may use. That's where [kmon](https://github.com/henriksen/kmon) comes in.\n\nkmon, pronounced kuh-mon, is an ASP.NET project command that watches the working directory of your project for changes to the files and restarts the web server automatically so that you have the same frictionless development experience that Visual Studio is presenting through the use of the Roslyn compiler.\n\nThis process is accomplished through wrapping nodemon, a node module that is designed to watch files and restart and/or execute processes.\n\n#### Requirements\n* node.js - [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org)\n* nodemon - `npm install -g nodemon`\n\n#### Adding kmon to your project\nkmon is a nuget package, [version 0.3.0](http://www.nuget.org/packages/kmon/) is the latest. \n\n`kpm install kmon`\n\nNext, you need to add the command to the commands portion of the project.json file and set the options.\n```language-javascript\n\"commands\": {\n    /* Change the port number when you are self hosting this application */\n    \"web\": \"Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting --server Microsoft.AspNet.Server.WebListener --server.urls http://localhost:5000\",\n    \"kestrel\": \"Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting --server Kestrel --server.urls http://localhost:5004\",\n    \"gen\": \"Microsoft.Framework.CodeGeneration\",\n    \"ef\": \"EntityFramework.Commands\",\n    \"mon\" : \"kmon --ext cs,json,js --server web\"\n},\n```\n\nthe options are:\n\n* --ext : the extensions of the files you would like to watch, the defaults are cs,json,js.\n* --server : the web server that you are going to use.  `web` for Windows, and `kestrel` for Linux, OSX. Default is `web`.\n\nIf you are using Brackets, for example, as your editor; open terminal and cd to your working folder and run the following command:\n\n`$ k kmon --server kestrel`\n\nThis command starts nodemon which subsequently starts kestrel.\n![terminal screen shot - started](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-13-at-8-22-34-AM-1.png)\n\nNow you can open the application in a browser, note the server url that is defined in the kestrel command within the project.json file `\"kestrel\": \"Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting --server Kestrel --server.urls http://localhost:5004\"`\n![web screen shot](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-13-at-8-24-04-AM.png)\n\nHere is a shot of the Brackets editor, note the **Name = \"Shayne Boyer\"** of the User class.\n![brackets before](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-13-at-8-25-34-AM.png)\n\nI change the **Name** property to **kmon!** and hit save in Brackets, nodemon detects the changes, and restarts kestrel.\n![terminal changes made](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-13-at-8-25-09-AM.png)\n\nGo back to the browser hit refresh and we are set. No rebuild step, no shutdown of the browser etc.\n![web screen shot](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-13-at-8-26-18-AM.png)\n\n### Sublime & Kulture\nUsing Sublime Text and the Kulture add-in you can get a UI experience and not have to use the command line.\n\nFrom Sublime Text do CMD + Shift + P, Run **K** Commands and you will see that the **k mon** command now shows in the options. Click the command and you will get the same experience.\n\n![Sublime Text 3 screenshot](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-13-at-8-43-01-AM.png)\n\nSee more about [Kulture](https://github.com/OmniSharp/Kulture) & [Omnisharp](http://omnisharp.net)\n\n#### So..Why a command? Why not Grunt, Gulp, etc...\n\nGood question.  Sure you can certainly use Gulp for example. There is an add-in [gulp-aspnet-k](https://github.com/tugberkugurlu/gulp-aspnet-k) that works.\n\n```language-javascript\ngulp.task('aspnet-run', aspnetk({\n    kCommand: 'kestrel' //default is 'web'\n}));\n```\n\nHere were the options that were on the table, when it was proposed - summarized from [OmniSharp/Kulture - Issue #5](https://github.com/OmniSharp/Kulture/issues/5) *it was originally called kestrelmon*\n\n***1. Create an ASP.NET Command***\n\nKulture and other editors have built in support for discovering and invoking commands in project. This is how kestrel,web, etc show up in the respective editors. So if we create a new command (that ships in a NuGet package) and users add an entry in the commands section pointing to it things will just work. When this command is invoked it will make the appropriate call to nodemon. This will work for editors and command line users.\n\n***2. Update Kulture and bake it in***\n\nKulture currently has built in support for kpm restore,kpm build & kpm pack. This is added to the sublime command list here. We could add a new kestrelmon command there as well.\n\n\nIn short, Option 1 gave more reach to all editors and long term options.\n\n#### Feedback\nWould love to see some feedback, feature requests - if there is something else we need this to do? Or keep it simple??\n\n","html":"<p>One of the new features in Visual Studio 2015 for ASP.NET 5 is an agile development environment.

The other value add is if you are a non Visual Studio user this solution works just the same.\n\n###Project Creation\nIn Visual Studio 2015, File > New Project > ASP.NET Web Application > ASP.NET 5 Empty\n![File New Project](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-30-at-9-43-10-AM.png)\n\nor using the <a href='http://www.tattoocoder.com/asp-net-vnext-project-creation-using-yeoman' target='_blank'>ASP.NET Yeoman Generator</a>\n\n```\n$ yo aspnet \n\n     _-----_\n    |       |    .--------------------------.\n    |--(o)--|    |      Welcome to the      |\n   `---------´   |   marvellous ASP.NET 5   |\n    ( _´U`_ )    |        generator!        |\n    /___A___\\    '--------------------------'\n     |  ~  |     \n   __'.___.'__   \n ´   `  |° ´ Y ` \n\n? What type of application do you want to create? MVC Application\n? What's the name of your ASP.NET application? (MvcApplication) GulpTypeScript\n```\n\n###Adding Gulp\nAdd a package.json file. \n\n![Add New Item - JSON File](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-30-at-10-10-21-AM.png)\n\nor using the <a href='http://www.tattoocoder.com/asp-net-vnext-project-creation-using-yeoman' target='_blank'>ASP.NET Yeoman Generator</a>\n\n```\n$ yo aspnet:PackageJSON\n```\n\nWithin `package.json` you will need to add the dependencies to support gulp. \n\n- **gulp**: Core gulp.js package\n- **gulp-tsc**: TypeScript compliler for gulp\n- **gulp-shell**: command line interface, can execute other processes etc.\n- **run-sequence**: run a series of tasks\n\n```language-javascript\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n    \"name\": \"GulpTypeScript\",\n    \"devDependencies\": {\n    \t\"gulp\": \"^3.8.5\", \n    \t\"gulp-tsc\": \"^0.9.1\", \n    \t\"gulp-shell\": \"^0.2.5\",\n    \t\"run-sequence\":\"^0.3.6\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUnlike nuget (project.json > dependencies node), the npm packages are not automatically restored/downloaded once the `package.json` is saved.  You can either expand the \"Dependencies\" node in the Solution Explorer and click \"Restore Packages\" or from a command line type `npm install`.\n\n![Restore Packages](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-30-at-11-11-06-AM.png)\n\nafter `npm install` completes...\n\n![packages restored](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-30-at-12-20-04-PM.png)\n\n####Adding the gulpfile.js\n\nUsing Visual Studio, Add New Item > JavaScript File > \"gulpfile.js\" or again using the aspnet Yeoman generator:\n```\n$ yo aspnet:JScript gruntfile\n```\n\n####Adding the tasks\n\nIn this example, we'll put in a few simple tasks\n\n- build\n- clean\n- default\n- rebuild\n\nthe most important item being the **build** task as this is where the TypeScript compilation happens.\n\nFirst declare the vars and dependencies...\n```language-javascript\n    var gulp = require('gulp'),\n        tsc = require('gulp-tsc'),\n        shell = require('gulp-shell'),\n        seq = require('run-sequence'),\n        del = require('del');\n```\n\nNext, set the source (src) and destination (dest) paths for your scripts...\n\n```language-javascript\n   var paths = {\n        ts: {\n            src: [\n                'scripts/ts/*.ts'\n            ],\n            dest : 'scripts'\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nHere, set the \"default\" task to be run\n\n```language-javascript\n   // Default\n    gulp.task('default', ['build']);\n```\n\nA clean task is defined to delete any javascript files that were compiled to the destination location.\n\n```language-javascript\n  // Clean\n    gulp.task('clean', function (cb) {\n        del(paths.ts.dest + '/*.js', cb);\n    })\n```\n\nNext, a **rebuild** task is defined to execute the **clean** then **build** sequetiallly.  You can use `gulp.start('clean', 'build')` but there is no guarantee what order the tasks will execute or complete in. So in that case the **run-sequence** npm package is used here.\n\n```language-javascript\n    // ReBuild - Clean & Build\n    gulp.task('rebuild', function (cb) {\n        seq('clean', 'build', cb);\n    });\n```\n\nFinally, the build task. Here the TypeScript compiler is leveraged using the `gulp-tsc` npm package passing in the arguments from the source location and producing the compiled JavaScript to the destination.\n```language-javascript\n    // Build\n    gulp.task('build', function () {\n        return gulp\n            .src(paths.ts.src)\n            .pipe(tsc({\n                module: \"CommonJS\",\n                sourcemap: true,\n                emitError: false\n            }))\n            .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.ts.dest));\n    });\n         \n```\n\nFor demo purposes, just grabbed the \"Simple Inheritance\" example from [TypeScriptLang.org](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground) and created \"animal.ts\" in the **/scripts/ts** folder.\n\n```language-javascript\nclass Animal {\n    constructor(public name: string) { }\n    move(meters: number) {\n        alert(this.name + \" moved \" + meters + \"m.\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Snake extends Animal {\n    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }\n    move() {\n        alert(\"Slithering...\");\n        super.move(5);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Horse extends Animal {\n    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }\n    move() {\n        alert(\"Galloping...\");\n        super.move(45);\n    }\n}\n\nvar sam = new Snake(\"Sammy the Python\");\nvar tom: Animal = new Horse(\"Tommy the Palomino\");\n\nsam.move();\ntom.move(34);\n\n```\n\nNow in order to produce the JavaScript, there are a few options as mentioned before. \n\n- Use [Web Essentials](http://vswebessentials.com)\n- Open the command line, now that we have defined the gulp tasks, and type `gulp [task name]`\n- Task Runner Explorer\n\n####Command Line\n\nPretty simple here, as mdentioned above, open your console in your working directoy\n\n```\n$ gulp build\n```\n\nOutput will be similar to (Windows)\n```\nC:\\Github\\GulpTypeScript\\src\\GulpTypeScript>gulp build\n[16:58:08] Using gulpfile C:\\Github\\GulpTypeScript\\src\\GulpTypeScript\\gulpfile.js\n[16:58:08] Starting 'build'...\n[16:58:08] Compiling TypeScript files using tsc version null\n[16:58:09] Finished 'build' after 1.01 s\n```\non OSX\n```\n$ gulp build\n[17:00:43] Using gulpfile ~/GulpTypeScript/gulpfile.js\n[17:00:43] Starting 'build'...\n[17:00:43] Compiling TypeScript files using tsc version null\n[17:00:43] Finished 'build' after 848 ms\n```\n\nThe output goes right to **/scripts** as expected.\n![output js](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-30-at-5-12-49-PM.png)\n\n####Bonus Task\n*Edit 01.05.2015* - Someone asked me was there a way to watch for file changes to recompile. Here is the task to add using the `.watch()` functionality of grunt.\n\n```language-javascript\n    gulp.task('watch', function () {\n        gulp.watch(paths.ts.src, ['build']);\n    });\n```\n\nThis task watches for file changes in the `src` directory, then executes the `build` task.  You could optionally put in multiple tasks or call any existing task.\n\n####Task Runner Explorer\n\nIn Visual Studio 2015, there is now Task Runner Explorer which gives you a visual look into your tasks.  This supports grunt and gulp.  Here is a shot of the window after running the **build** task.\n\n![Task Runner Explorer](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-30-at-5-02-13-PM.png)\n\n##Note\nOn Windows you may encounter a strange error when executing the tasks. This is an issue when you have multiple versions of TypeScript installed.\n\nThe error: **Failed to compile TypeScript: Error: Command failed: Cannot initialize ActiveScript**\n![](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-29-at-3-34-22-PM.png)\n\nThere is an easy fix, just go to to C:\\Program Files(x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\TypeScript \nand remove the previous versions.\n![](/content/images/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-29-at-3-37-26-PM.png)\n\n###Summary\nThere is a lot more you can add to the grunt file as you may or may not know, there are minification, image optimization and a ton more.  I like the way of gulp as it allows for the non VS and Visual Studio developers to put together the code in the same manner.  Not to toss out Web Essentials, cause that is an awesome add-in and there would be many of features not in VS without it.","html":"<p><a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com\" rel=\"tag\" style=\"display:none\">CodeProject</a></p>\n\n<div style=\"height:200px;width:100px;margin:5px;float:right;\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/12/gulp.png\" alt=\"gulp image\" />\n</div>\n\n<p>If you have done any typescript development in Visual Studio in previous versions, you more than like are using the <a href=\"http://vswebessentials.com/\">Web Essentials</a> add in to perform the compilation to Javascript.

The overall concept is not too dissimilar from previous examples you may have seen using **X** type of database, however there are some areas covered that are either new in MVC 6 that you may find you didn't know are there. \n\n####Topics Covered\n- ConfigurationModel\n\t- config.json\n\t- Environment Variables\n- OptionsModel\n- Dependency Injection (IServiceCollection)\n- Forcing JSON or Removing XML Formatter, Content Negotiation\n- MongoDB\n\t- Installation (OSX & Windows)\n\t- mongocsharpdriver (nuget package)\n- Testing endpoints w/ Postman or Fiddler\n\n###Project Creation\nDepending on your environment (Windows or OS X) or preference you have a choice on how you can create the ASP.NET project.  \n\n######Visual Studio 2015 Preview\nLaunch Visual Studio 2015 Preview and **File** > **New Project** > **Web** > **ASP.NET 5 Empty**.\n![New Project Dialog](/content/images/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-11-36-29-AM.png)\n    \n#####ASP.NET Yeoman Project Generator \n([see walkthrough here](http://www.tattoocoder.com/asp-net-vnext-project-creation-using-yeoman/)) - note that the MVC Project is the best choice for this example, there is not an \"Empty\" template.\n\n```\n$ yo aspnet\n\n     _-----_\n    |       |    .--------------------------.\n    |--(o)--|    |      Welcome to the      |\n   `---------´   |   marvellous ASP.NET 5   |\n    ( _´U`_ )    |        generator!        |\n    /___A___\\    '--------------------------'\n     |  ~  |     \n   __'.___.'__   \n ´   `  |° ´ Y ` \n\n? What type of application do you want to create? MVC Application\n? What's the name of your ASP.NET application? (MvcApplication) mongomvc\n  \n```\n\n###Setting up the dependencies\nOpen the **project.json** file and add the following to the dependencies node.\n\n```language-javascript\n\"dependencies\": {\n        \"Microsoft.AspNet.Server.IIS\":\"1.0.0-beta1\",\n        \"Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc\": \"6.0.0-beta1\",\n        \"Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting\": \"1.0.0-beta1\",\n        \"Microsoft.AspNet.Diagnostics\": \"1.0.0-beta1\",\n        \"Microsoft.AspNet.Server.WebListener\": \"1.0.0-beta1\",\n        \"Microsoft.Framework.ConfigurationModel.Json\": \"1.0.0-beta1\",\n        \"Kestrel\": \"1.0.0-beta1\",\n        \"mongocsharpdriver\": \"1.8.3\"\n    }\n```\n\n- **Microsoft.AspNet.Server.IIS** : Server Implemenation for ASP.NET 5\n- **Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting** : Core hosting infrastructure for ASP.NET 5\n- **Microsoft.AspNet.Diagnostics** : Middleware for error pages, diagnostics etc.\n- **Microsoft.AspNet.Server.WebListener** : Self host web server\n- **Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc** : ASP.NET MVC Framework\n- **Microsoft.Framework.ConfigurationModel.Json** : JSON configuration source for the ConfigurationModel\n- **Kestrel** : Server for hosting on OS X, Linux\n- **mongocsharpdriver** : MongoDB Driver\n\nEach of these should be self explanatory with the exception of maybe the **ConfigurationModel.Json** package, which will be covered when we get into the settings portion of the walkthrough.\n\nOnce you save the file, in Visual Studio, the packages will be restored from nuget.  If you are using a non Visual Studio editor, then execute `kpm restore` from the command line to get the packages.\n\n###Startup.cs\nStartup.cs is the entry point for your application; this is where the configuration, services, dependency injectection etc. is configured.\n\nIn the following snippet, the `ConfigureServices` method is used to add our services into the pipleline and expose the `IServiceCollection` for dependeny injection. It also sets the `Configure` method to tell the app which services in the pipeline to use on start.\n\n```language-csharp\n\npublic class Startup\n{\n\tpublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n    {\n    \tservices.AddMvc();\n    }\n    \n    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)\n    {\n    \tapp.UseMvc();\n        app.UseWelcomePage();\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nAt this point you can `F5` (VS2015), `k web` (Win) or `k kestrel` (Linux or OSX) to run the app and see the Welcome Page.\n\n![Welcome Page](/content/images/2015/01/aspnet_welcompage.png)\n\nLet's add a few items to this to round out the bootstrapping of the application.\n\n**Remove XML Formatters** - if you have done any ASP.NET Web API development in the past, the format of the output is dependant on the `Content-Type` header that is passed when a GET request is made.  By default the response type will be JSON, however if the client send `application/xml` that is what will be returned.  You can force JSON results for all returns by adding the following to the `ConfigureServices()` method:\n\n```language-csharp\n\n services.Configure<MvcOptions>(options =>\n                                     options\n                                     .OutputFormatters\n                                     .RemoveAll(formatter => formatter.Instance is XmlDataContractSerializerOutputFormatter)\n                                           );\n\n```\n\nIf you wish to control this at a more finite level, please see [Content Negotiation in MVC 5 or How Can I Just Write JSON](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2014/11/24/content-negotiation-in-mvc-5-or-how-can-i-just-write-json.aspx)\n\n###Configuration\n\nGone are the days of web.config, XML transforms for deploying to environments.  Now, as with many things in ASP.NET \"vNext, you get more choice.  \n\nThere are multiple file formats supported; XML, JSON, and INI are all supported out of the box. The other option is Environment variables, a characteristic of node.js as well as other frameworks.  \n\nHere is an example of how you can use the new ConfigurationModel to take advantage of the new confuration files.\n\n```\nconfig.json\n{\n\t\"key\" : \"value\"\n}\n\nconfig.ini\nkey = value\n\nconfig.xml\n<key>\n\t<value>value</value>\n</key>\n\n```\n\nEnvironment variables in Azure\n![Azure Env Variables](/content/images/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-16-at-10-34-34-AM.png)\n\n```language-csharp\n\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)\n    {\n        // Setup configuration sources\n        var configuration = new Configuration();\n        configuration.AddJsonFile(“config.json”);\n        configuration.AddIniFile(“config.ini”);\n        configuration.AddXmlFile(“config.xml”);\n        configuration.AddEnvironmentVariables();\n \n        // …\n    }\n\n```\nAccessing the values\n```language-csharp\nvar configuration = new Configuration();\nconfiguration.AddJsonFile(\"config.json);\nconfiguration.Get(\"key\");\n```\n\nA couple notes concerning configuration:\n\n* order matters, last one wins\n* not just a key/value pair. Complex structures supported\n\nSo how does this apply to this project? Let's add it to the **Startup.cs**.\n\nAdd the following to constructor\n\n```language-csharp\npublic Startup()\n{\n\tConfiguration = new Configuration()\n\t\t.AddJsonFile(\"config.json\")\n\t\t.AddEnvironmentVariables();\n}\n```\n\nNext, add the `IConfiguration` interface so we can take advantage of DI \n\n```language-csharp\npublic IConfiguration Configuration { get; set; }\n```\n\nAnother new item we have is the the IOptions interface which allows us to bind the configuration file to a class. This is available in the Microsoft.Framework.OptionsModel namespace. Given that, let's create a new class call **Settings.cs** to hold the values from the config.json file we'll be creating shortly.\n\n```language-csharp\npublic class Settings\n{\n\tpublic string Database { get; set; }\n\tpublic string MongoConnection { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nnow create the **config.json** file\n\n```language-javascript\n{\n    \"mongoconnection\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017\",\n    \"database\":  \"mongomvc\"\n}\n```\n\nNow, add the code to the **ConfigureServices()** method\n\nFirst, change the services.AddMvc() to include our configuration\n```language-csharp\nservices.addMvc(Configuration)\n```\nnow add this line to configure the settings to be configured and bind based on the configuration\n```language-csharp\nservices.Configure<Settings>(Configuration);\n```\n\nNow that the application is bootstrapped for Configuration, Dependency Injection, JSON formatting; let's get the datastore setup in MongoDB and then we'll come back to round out the app with the Controller, Model and DataRepository.\n\n###MongoDB\nThere are a few reasons I chose MongoDB for this example. \n\n* its a popular NoSQL datastore\n* has a nuget package for C#\n* supported on Azure\n* equal tooling support on OSX and Windows.\n\n####Installation\nInstallation is a breeze.  If you are on OSX you can use HomeBrew to install by executing `$ brew install mongodb`, and if you are using Windows I would highly suggest using [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/) to do the installation. Chocolately installs MongoDB, the shell and the Windows service and is equivalent to the OSX install with HomeBrew. \n\n```\n> choco install mongodb\n```\n\n####Tools\nIf you prefer GUI interfaces, the best one I have found is [RoboMongo](http://robomongo.org/). It is cross platform and provides a great way to explore your collections. You can also connect to you local stores as well as remote stores such as [MongoLab](http://mongolab.com)(Azure provider).\n\n\n####Test Data\nOnce you have installed MongoDB, open terminal and connect to the database by the following command\n\n```\n$ mongo mongomvc\n```\n\n**mongo** starts the terminal command, and the second paramter connects or creates the store. Next copy and paste the test data into the terminal and hit enter.\n\n```\ndb.speakers.insert({\n    first: 'Shayne',\n    last: 'Boyer',\n    twitter: '@spboyer',\n    title: 'Developer Guy',\n    blog: 'tattoocoder.com'\n});\n\ndb.speakers.insert({\n    first: 'Scott',\n    last: 'Hanselman',\n    twitter: '@shanselman',\n    title: 'Teacher Blogger Guy',\n    blog: 'hanselman.com'\n});\n\ndb.speakers.insert({\n    first: 'John',\n    last: 'Papa',\n    twitter: '@john_papa',\n    title: 'JavaScript Angular Guy',\n    blog: 'johnpapa.net'\n});\n\ndb.speakers.insert({\n    first: 'Mads',\n    last: 'Kristensen',\n    twitter: '@mkristensen',\n    title: 'Web Essentials Guy',\n    blog: 'about.me/madskristensen'\n});\n\ndb.speakers.insert({\n    first: 'Damian',\n    last: 'Edwards',\n    twitter: '@DamianEdwards',\n    title: 'ASP.NET Demo Guy',\n    blog: 'damianedwards.wordpress.com'\n});\n\ndb.speakers.insert({\n    first: 'Jon',\n    last: 'Galloway',\n    twitter: '@jongalloway',\n    title: 'ASP.NET Community Guy',\n    blog: 'weblogs.asp.net/jongalloway'\n});\n\n```\n\nThis creates all of the data in the **mongomvc** datastore under the **speakers** collection. You can see the data by querying in terminal or viewing in RoboMongo.\n\n```\n$ db.speakers.find()\n```\n\n![RoboMongo - OSX](/content/images/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-16-at-12-55-15-PM.png)\n\n###Adding the Model\nAdd the **Models** folder under the root, and a **Speaker.cs** file. \n\n> using the yeoman generator **generator-aspnet** you can add a class with \n\n>`$ yo aspnet:Class Speaker`\n\n```language-charp\n    public class Speaker\n    {\n        public ObjectId Id { get; set; }\n\n        [BsonElement(\"first\")]\n        public string First { get; set; }\n\n        [BsonElement(\"last\")]\n        public string Last { get; set; }\n\n        [BsonElement(\"twitter\")]\n        public string Twitter { get; set; }\n\n        [BsonElement(\"title\")]\n        public string Title { get; set; }\n\n        [BsonElement(\"blog\")]\n        public string Blog { get; set; }\n\n    }\n```\n\nA few things to point out in this class is the attribute annotations\n```\n[BsonElement(\"first\")]\n```\nThese are neccessary for the binding because the mongo nuget package binding serialization is case sensitive.\n\n###Adding the Repository\nAdd the **SpeakerRepository.cs** class, in this case just under the root.\n\n> using the yeoman generator **generator-aspnet** you can add a class with \n\n>`$ yo aspnet:Class SpeakerRepository`\n\nThe interface is simple\n\n```language-csharp\npublic interface ISpeakerRespository\n{\n\tIEnumerable<Speaker> AllSpeakers();\n\n\tSpeaker GetById(ObjectId id);\n\n\tvoid Add(Speaker speaker);\n\n\tvoid Update(Speaker speaker);\n\n\tbool Remove(ObjectId id);\n}\n```\n\nAnd implement the interface.  In the constructor, we'll take advantage of DI and get the **Settings** class that contains the connection information for the MongoDB instance. This is accessed from  IOptions<T>\n\n```language-csharp\npublic SpeakerRepository(IOptions<Settings> settings)\n{\n\t_settings = settings.Options;\n    _database = Connect();\n}\n```\n\nHere is the complete class implementation.\n\n```language-csharp\npublic class SpeakerRepository : ISpeakerRespository\n{\n  private readonly Settings _settings;\n  private readonly MongoDatabase _database;\n  \n  public SpeakerRepository(IOptions<Settings> settings)\n  {\n    _settings = settings.Options;\n    _database = Connect();\n  }\n\n  public void Add(Speaker speaker)\n  {\n  \t_database.GetCollection<Speaker>(\"speakers\").Save(speaker);\n  }\n\n  public IEnumerable<Speaker> AllSpeakers()\n  {\n    var speakers = _database.GetCollection<Speaker>(\"speakers\").FindAll();\n    return speakers;\n  }\n\n  public Speaker GetById(ObjectId id)\n  {\n    var query = Query<Speaker>.EQ(e => e.Id, id);\n    var speaker = _database.GetCollection<Speaker>(\"speakers\").FindOne(query);\n\n    return speaker;\n  }\n\n  public bool Remove(ObjectId id)\n  {\n    var query = Query<Speaker>.EQ(e => e.Id, id);\n    var result = _database.GetCollection<Speaker>(\"speakers\").Remove(query);\n\n    return GetById(id) == null;\n  }\n\n  public void Update(Speaker speaker)\n  {\n    var query = Query<Speaker>.EQ(e => e.Id, speaker.Id);\n    var update = Update<Speaker>.Replace(speaker); // update modifiers\n    _database.GetCollection<Speaker>(\"speakers\").Update(query, update);\n  }\n\n  private MongoDatabase Connect()\n  {\n    var client = new MongoClient(_settings.MongoConnection);\n    var server = client.GetServer();\n    var database = server.GetDatabase(_settings.Database);\n\n    return database;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#####Add the SpeakerRepository to ServiceCollection\nOpen **Startup.cs** and add the following to the **ConfigureServices()** method to setup the ISpeakerRepository for DI so it can be injected into the SpeakerController.\n\n```language-charp\nservices.AddSingleton<ISpeakerRespository, SpeakerRepository>();\n```\n\n> options on Dependency Injection\n\n> * .AddTransient - whenever I ask for it give me a new one\n> * .AddLifetime - scoped to the current request, regardless of how many times it's asked for\n> * .AddSingleton - one ever\n\n###Adding the Controller\nAdd the **Controllers** folder under the root, and the add a MVC Controller named **SpeakerController.cs**\n\n> using the yeoman generator **generator-aspnet** you can add a MVC Controller with \n\n> `$ yo aspnet:MvcController SpeakerController`\n\nIn the constructor, add the ISpeakerRepository so we have access to the datastore calls.\n\n```language-csharp\nreadonly ISpeakerRespository _speakerRepository;\npublic SpeakerController(ISpeakerRespository speakerRepository)\n{\n\t_speakerRepository = speakerRepository;\n}\n```\n\nAdd a default GET to return all of the speakers\n```language-csharp\n[HttpGet]\npublic IEnumerable<Speaker> GetAll()\n{\n\tvar speakers = _speakerRepository.AllSpeakers();\n\treturn speakers;\n}\n```\n\nAdd a GET to return a specific speaker.  In this case the ObjectId string, the default key from MongoDB, is used. As such as route constraint is added to validate the length of the string being passed. **{id:length(24)}** and a *RouteName* is added so we can call this by route by name using **Url.RouteUrl()**.\n```language-csharp\n[HttpGet(\"{id:length(24)}\", Name = \"GetByIdRoute\")]\npublic IActionResult GetById(string id)\n{\n\tvar item = _speakerRepository.GetById(new ObjectId(id));\n\tif (item == null)\n\t{\n\t\treturn HttpNotFound();\n\t}\n\n\treturn new ObjectResult(item);\n}\n```\n\nAdd a Create method, with a **[FromBody]** attribute on the argument to indicate that the object should be serialized from the body of the message.\n\n```language-csharp\n[HttpPost]\npublic void CreateSpeaker([FromBody] Speaker speaker)\n{\n  if (!ModelState.IsValid)\n  {\n  \tContext.Response.StatusCode = 400;\n  }\n  else\n  {\n  \t_speakerRepository.Add(speaker);\n\n  \tstring url = Url.RouteUrl(\"GetByIdRoute\", new { id = speaker.Id.ToString() }, Request.Scheme, Request.Host.ToUriComponent());\n  \tContext.Response.StatusCode = 201;\n  \tContext.Response.Headers[\"Location\"] = url;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, the Delete to round out the repository functions.\n\n```language-csharp\n[HttpDelete(\"{id:length(24)}\")]\npublic IActionResult DeleteSpeaker(string id)\n{\n  if (_speakerRepository.Remove(new ObjectId(id)))\n  {\n  \treturn new HttpStatusCodeResult(204); // 204 No Content\n  }\n  else\n  {\n  \treturn HttpNotFound();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n###Testing\nSome Various tools are available for testing HTTP services.  [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) from [Telerik](http://telerik.com) is a favorite if you are on Windows, I also like the [Postman Chrome Add-in](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en). I happen to like either, Postman saves the urls you hit which is nice when are testing over and over or complex endpoints.\n\nSo, if you run the application now you can use the tool of your choice and hit the endpoint: \n\n* `k web` - http://localhost:5001/api/speaker \n* `k kestrel` - http://localhost:5004/api/speaker\n* Visual Studio - http://localost:[randomPort]/api/speaker\n\n![postman GET](/content/images/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-16-at-1-53-59-PM.png)\n\n\nSelect a specifid \"Id\" and add it the url, i.e.\n\nhttp://localhost:5004/api/speaker/54b7d51140c10266ffa3b04d and a single item is returned.\n\n```language-javascript\n{\n    \"Id\": \"54b7d51140c10266ffa3b04d\",\n    \"First\": \"Shayne\",\n    \"Last\": \"Boyer\",\n    \"Twitter\": \"@spboyer\",\n    \"Title\": \"Developer Guy\",\n    \"Blog\": \"tattoocoder.com\"\n}\n```\n\nto test a POST or the Create endpoint, change the drop down to POST, select the RAW option and add the following data.\n\nAlso add the **Content-Type: application/json** header.\n\n```language-javascript\n{\n    \"First\": \"Sayed\",\n    \"Last\": \"Hashimi\",\n    \"Twitter\": \"@sayedihashimi\",\n    \"Title\": \"MSBuild Guy\",\n    \"Blog\": \"sedodream.com\"\n}\n```\n\n![Postman POST](/content/images/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-16-at-2-09-16-PM.png)\n\nAfter executing the POST you can either query the /speaker endpoint or look directly in the datastore and see the new speaker inserted.\n\n![RoboMongo Windows](/content/images/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-16-at-2-13-28-PM.png)\n\nFull source for this example is available on GitHub -> http://github.com/spboyer/mongomvc\n\n\n###Resources\n[C# and .NET MongoDB Driver](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/csharp/) - (docs.mongodb.org)\n\n[Content Negotiation in MVC 5 or How Can I Just Write JSON](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2014/11/24/content-negotiation-in-mvc-5-or-how-can-i-just-write-json.aspx) - (blogs.msdn.com)\n\n[ASP.NET Yeoman Generator Project Scaffolding](http://www.tattoocoder.com/asp-net-vnext-project-creation-using-yeoman/) - (tattoocoder.com)\n\n[ASP.NET](http://asp.net) - (asp.net)\n\n[ASP.NET Github](http://github.com/aspnet/home) - (github.com/aspnet/home)\n","html":"<p>This is a quick walkthrough on using ASP.NET 5 to build a Web API layer using MongoDB.

Your compiled code will now be packaged in nuget packages (.nupkg) within the /approot folder and each targeted framework will have its own nupkg.\n\nDepending on your project team(s), the tools used the new structure may or may no cause issue with the move that is being made to the community standards such as grunt, gulp, bower, npm etc.\n\n####A Quick Example\nThe default File -> New Project -> ASP.NET 5 Empty Project presents the following solution structure in Visual Studio.\n\n![new project structure](/content/images/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-29-at-1-53-18-PM.png)\n\nThe next step is to add the bower.json file for me to get the CSS and JavaScript libraries to work with such as Angular and Bootstrap.\n\nbower.json file\n```language-javascript\n\n{\n\t\"name\": \"NewASP5Project\",\n\t\"private\": true,\n\t\"dependencies\": {\n\t\t\"angular\": \"~1.3.11\",\n\t\t\"bootstrap\": \"~3.3.2\"\n\t},\n    \"exportsOverride\": {\n    }\n}\n\n```\nThis creates the dependencies and the bower_components (hidden) folder in the same directory as your project.\n\n![after bower](/content/images/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-29-at-2-03-03-PM.png)\n\nMost examples you've probably seen to this point would invlove adding a grunt file which would then **copy** the necessary bower resources to a ***new*** folder under wwwroot, something like ***/lib***. Then you reference these *.css and *.js resources from the /lib folder in the .html files during development.\n\nThere are of course options in the bower.json file within **exportsOverride** to control what exactly gets copied to the destination folder during the grunt task; such as only getting the minified versions etc.\n\nThere is a full walkthrough of the example on the ASP.NET site here - [Grunt and Bower in Visual Studio 2015](http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/aspnet-vnext/grunt-and-bower-in-visual-studio-2015).\n\n####So What is the Problem?\nHere are a few items to point out.\n\n* There are duplicate copies of the bower resources\n* The example works for grunt, not gulp\n* wwwroot is unecessary\n\n####Optional?\nIn short, yes.  With a change to project.json you can either remove the *wwroot* folder OR call it *foo* if you like and the application will execute normally.\n\nThis is done by changing the value of `webroot` from `'wwwroot'` to simply `'.'` or `'foo'` depending on your preference.  In this case we are looking to eliminate the folder need and work right from the true root of the project. Look at this example project.json:\n\n```language-javascript\n{\n  \"webroot\": \".\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0-*\",\n  \"exclude\": [\n    \"wwwroot\",\n    \"bower_components\"\n  ],\n  \"packExclude\": [\n    \"node_modules\",\n    \"bower_components\",\n    \"**.kproj\",\n    \"**.user\",\n    \"**.vspscc\"\n  ],\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"Microsoft.AspNet.Server.IIS\": \"1.0.0-beta2\",\n    \"Microsoft.AspNet.Server.WebListener\": \"1.0.0-beta2\",\n    \"Microsoft.AspNet.StaticFiles\": \"1.0.0-beta2\",\n    \"Microsoft.AspNet.Diagnostics\": \"1.0.0-beta2\",\n    \"Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc\": \"6.0.0-beta2\",\n    \"Kestrel\": \"1.0.0-beta2\",\n    \"Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp\": \"1.0.0.0-beta2\"\n  },\n  \"commands\": {\n    \"web\": \"Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting --server Microsoft.AspNet.Server.WebListener --server.urls http://localhost:5001\",\n    \"kestrel\": \"Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting --server Kestrel --server.urls http://localhost:5004\"\n  },\n  \"frameworks\": {\n    \"aspnet50\": {},\n    \"aspnetcore50\": {}\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"postrestore\": [\n      \"npm install\"\n    ],\n    \"prepare\": [\n      \"gulp prepare\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis file sets the webroot to '.', telling the web application that the true root is where we will be executing from. Now when you add bower to the project, the **bower_components** folder is at the same level as your other resources. \n\n>*In Visual Studio you'll have to \"Show All Files\", Right Click and \"Include in Project\". By doing so you can directly reference the resources in the bower_components folder in your html without having to copy duplicates into another folder. However, note that you only really need to do this if you want the nice intellisense when coding, resources will still resolve.*\n\n####But What about deployment?\nRight, you certainly wouldn't deplpoy the bower_components folder to the server.  That's where grunt or gulp helps out and in this example - gulp.\n\n>Check out John Papa's repository - [gulp-patterns](https://github.com/johnpapa/gulp-patterns), and note that there is an upcoming [Pluralsight](http://pluralsight.com/) course associated with this soon!\n\n####Gulp - inject, wiredep and more.\nInstead of typing all of the bower resources into your html, use the gulp plugin called **wiredep**.\n\nIn the html page you insert the following comment tags to indicate where to inject the css and javascript.\n\n```language-html\n<!-- bower:css -->\n\n<!-- endbower -->\n\n<!-- bower:js -->\n\n<!-- endbower -->\n```\n\nThen in your gulpfile.js a task is defined\n```language-javascript\n\nvar wiredep = require('wiredep').stream;\n    var options = config.getWiredepDefaultOptions();\n\n    return gulp\n        .src(config.index)\n        .pipe(wiredep(options))\n        .pipe($.inject(gulp.src(config.js)))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(config.client));\n\n```\n\nwhen the task is executed, the result is the follwing\n```language-html\n<!-- bower:css -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css\" />\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"bower_components/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css\" />\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"bower_components/toastr/toastr.css\" />\n<!-- endbower -->\n\n<!-- bower:js -->\n<script src=\"bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/angular/angular.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/angular-sanitize/angular-sanitize.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/angular-resource/angular-resource.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/extras.angular.plus/ngplus-overlay.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/moment/moment.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/angular-ui-router/release/angular-ui-router.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/toastr/toastr.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/angular-animate/angular-animate.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/html5shiv/dist/html5shiv.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/respond/dest/respond.src.js\"></script>\n<!-- endbower -->\n```\n\nFor your own scripts, or non bower resources; **gulp-inject** gives you the same result by using `<!-- inject:cs -->` and `<!-- inject:js -->` respectively.\n\n####Great for Static Stuff, What about my ASP.NET?\nHere is the folder structure of the application:\n![app structure](/content/images/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-29-at-3-54-31-PM.png)\n\n* /app - Angular.js code\n* /server - .NET API code\n\nApplication can be run from the Debug dropdown and executes in Helios (IIS) and runs the Angular app on index.html calling the API controllers.\n\n####What about cross platform development?\nIn project.json there is a reference to the Kestrel server host for OSX and Linux. You can open the application in Sublime, Brackets, Atom etc.  I happen to use Sublime and Brackets.\n\nUsing Sublime, and the [OmniSharp](http://omnisharp.net) as well Kulture addins; ASP.NET development experience is a breeze.\n\nOpen the project, run `kpm restore` to install all **bower, nuget, and npm** dependencies then run the application using `k kestrel` and browse to **http://localhost:5004** \n\n####Summary\nNo need to have a wwwroot, a duplicated set of resources.  If there is already a set and we have grunt, gulp, npm and bower integration within our ecosystem; let's start using them and reduce the reptative work.  Curious how you are working with the new set of tools, give me your thoughts. \n\n\n####Source\nSource code available here - https://github.com/spboyer/nowwwroot\n\n\n","html":"<h5 id=\"updated1302014\">Updated - 1.30.2014</h5>\n\n<p>After looking at the kpm pack or publishing step of this solution, there is an undesired affect. </p>\n\n<p>All of the folders in the root, now that this is the folder we are working in, will be published to the destination folders.

Then you reference these *.css and *.js resources from the /lib folder in the .html files during development.</p>\n\n<p>There are of course options in the bower.json file within <strong>exportsOverride</strong> to control what exactly gets copied to the destination folder during the grunt task; such as only getting the minified versions etc.</p>\n\n<p>There is a full walkthrough of the example on the ASP.NET site here - <a href=\"http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/aspnet-vnext/grunt-and-bower-in-visual-studio-2015\">Grunt and Bower in Visual Studio 2015</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"sowhatistheproblem\">So What is the Problem?</h4>\n\n<p>Here are a few items to point out.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There are duplicate copies of the bower resources</li>\n<li>The example works for grunt, not gulp</li>\n<li>wwwroot is unecessary</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"optional\">Optional?</h4>\n\n<p>In short, yes.  With a change to project.json you can either remove the <em>wwroot</em> folder OR call it <em>foo</em> if you like and the application will execute normally.</p>\n\n<p>This is done by changing the value of <code>webroot</code> from <code>'wwwroot'</code> to simply <code>'.'</code> or <code>'foo'</code> depending on your preference.  In this case we are looking to eliminate the folder need and work right from the true root of the project. Look at this example project.json:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">{\n  \"webroot\": \".\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0-*\",\n  \"exclude\": [\n    \"wwwroot\",\n    \"bower_components\"\n  ],\n  \"packExclude\": [\n    \"node_modules\",\n    \"bower_components\",\n    \"**.kproj\",\n    \"**.user\",\n    \"**.vspscc\"\n  ],\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"Microsoft.AspNet.Server.IIS\": \"1.0.0-beta2\",\n    \"Microsoft.AspNet.Server.WebListener\": \"1.0.0-beta2\",\n    \"Microsoft.AspNet.StaticFiles\": \"1.0.0-beta2\",\n    \"Microsoft.AspNet.Diagnostics\": \"1.0.0-beta2\",\n    \"Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc\": \"6.0.0-beta2\",\n    \"Kestrel\": \"1.0.0-beta2\",\n    \"Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp\": \"1.0.0.0-beta2\"\n  },\n  \"commands\": {\n    \"web\": \"Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting --server Microsoft.AspNet.Server.WebListener --server.urls http://localhost:5001\",\n    \"kestrel\": \"Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting --server Kestrel --server.urls http://localhost:5004\"\n  },\n  \"frameworks\": {\n    \"aspnet50\": {},\n    \"aspnetcore50\": {}\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"postrestore\": [\n      \"npm install\"\n    ],\n    \"prepare\": [\n      \"gulp prepare\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This file sets the webroot to '.', telling the web application that the true root is where we will be executing from. Now when you add bower to the project, the <strong>bower_components</strong> folder is at the same level as your other resources. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>In Visual Studio you'll have to \"Show All Files\", Right Click and \"Include in Project\". By doing so you can directly reference the resources in the bower_components folder in your html without having to copy duplicates into another folder. However, note that you only really need to do this if you want the nice intellisense when coding, resources will still resolve.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4 id=\"butwhataboutdeployment\">But What about deployment?</h4>\n\n<p>Right, you certainly wouldn't deplpoy the bower_components folder to the server.

On top of the responsive design, which has a new carousel control, it is also touch ready using hammer.js and is using grunt as the task runner.\n\nAnother popular task runner is gulp.js, and in the next release there will be a default template provided. However, in the meantime as a part of the yeoman generator project I wanted to not only provide an equivalent for the grunt template, but also one that could be built upon.\n\n###gruntfile.js\nFirst let's take a quick look at the grunt file \n\n```language-javascript\nmodule.exports = function (grunt) {\n    grunt.initConfig({\n        bower: {\n            install: {\n                options: {\n                    targetDir: \"wwwroot/lib\",\n                    layout: \"byComponent\",\n                    cleanTargetDir: false\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    // This command registers the default task which will install bower packages into wwwroot/lib\n    grunt.registerTask(\"default\", [\"bower:install\"]);\n\n    // The following line loads the grunt plugins.\n    // This line needs to be at the end of this this file.\n    grunt.loadNpmTasks(\"grunt-bower-task\");\n};\n\n```\n\nthe purpose of these tasks is to simply install the bower resources set in the **bower.json** file, then copy these resources to the **www/lib** folder.  \n\nThe task runner here is dependant on two npm packages; grunt and grunt-bower-task respectively.  These are defined in **package.json**\n\n```language-javascript\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n    \"name\": \"MyApplicationName\",\n    \"devDependencies\": {\n        \"grunt\": \"0.4.5\",\n        \"grunt-bower-task\": \"0.4.0\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n####Running the tasks\nYou have two options for running the tasks.\n\n* Visual Studio 2015 Task Runner Explorer\n![task runner explorer](/content/images/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-09-at-8-35-24-PM.png)\n* Command Line ` $ MyApplicationName > grunt `\n\n###gulpfile.js\n\nIn order to accomplish the same functionality as the grunt task, you'll need to add the two npm packages for gulp to the **package.json** file and remove the gulp ones. We'll also add another for cleaning the destination folder.\n\n* gulp\n* gulp-bower\n* del\n\n```language-javascript\n\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n    \"name\": \"MyApplicationName\",\n    \"devDependencies\": {\n        \"del\": \"^1.1.1\",\n        \"gulp\": \"^3.8.10\",\n        \"gulp-bower\": \"0.0.10\"\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nNext, add a new JavaScript file name **gulpfile.js**. Now by contrast to grunt, gulp is more suited for coding versus configuration ( *json* ).\n\nFirst, add the dependencies.\n\n```language-javascript\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar bower = require('gulp-bower');\nvar del = require('del');\n```\n\nNext, we'll add a variable to load the **project.json** file so we can get the **webroot** location, then set a variable to use for the **lib** location.\n\n```language-javascript\nvar project = require('./project.json');\nvar lib = project.webroot + '/lib';\n```\n\nThe first task added to the file is the **clean** task that takes the **lib** folder and deletes the content.\n\n```language-javascript\ngulp.task('clean', function (done) {\n    del(lib, done);\n});\n```\n\nNext, add the task for running **bower install** to install all of the components to the defaul folder *bower_components*. This task, also will call the **clean** task first.\n\n```language-javascript\ngulp.task('bower:install', ['clean'], function () {\n    return bower({\n        directory: lib\n    });\n});\n```\n\nFinally, setup the **default** gulp task.  This is the task that is called if you use the CLI (Command Line Interface) and execute `$ gulp`.\n\n```language-javascript\ngulp.task('default', ['bower:install'], function () {\n    return;\n});\n```\n\nThe complete file should look like the following:\n\n```language-javascript\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar bower = require('gulp-bower');\nvar del = require('del');\nvar project = require('./project.json');\nvar lib = project.webroot + '/lib';\n\ngulp.task('default', ['bower:install'], function () {\n    return;\n});\n\ngulp.task('bower:install', ['clean'], function () {\n    return bower({\n        directory: lib\n    });\n});\n\ngulp.task('clean', function (done) {\n    del(lib, done);\n});\n```\n\nAgain, the same options for running the tasks as before. However, there are a few items I noticed when using the CLI. First, there are commented lines in the **project.json** which are not supported by the JSON specification and the CLI will throw and error so remove these.\n\nSecondly, I also noticed that the gulp tasks were not showing in the Task Runner Explorer and the errors were not very descriptive.  However, it did get resolved by removing the comments and I aslo installed the **gulp-cli** package.  \n\nFrom the command line\n```\n> npm install -g gulp-cli\n```\n\n*As a note Visual Studio installs all of the packages locally to the project, if you are using gulp or grunt install them globally so the cli tools are available.*\n\nAdditional bower resources can be added such as Angular.js and when the default task is run either from the CLI or the Task Runner Explorer; the files will be downloaded from the bower repository and then also placed in the **www/lib** folder were you can reference in your *.cshtml files.\n\nIt is important to point out that it doesn't matter which way you decide to run the tasks, as the Task Runner Explorer is simply a GUI that calls the CLI. Some developers prefer one over the other, and now that ASP.NET 5 is cross platform there may be developers using other non Visual Studio IDE and now the capability is not lost on those developers.\n\n###Notes\n\nThe next release of the yeoman generators, [generator-aspnet](http://github.com/OmniSharp/generator-aspnet) will contain and option to generate the **web** template with a gulp task runner instead of the default gulp.\n\n` $ yo aspnet --gulp`\n\nI would also encourage the use of the **wiredep** package with gulp.  This package injects the bower packages into your *.html* files by decorating them with a simple comment. Here is an example of that task.\n\n```language-javascript\ngulp.task('wiredep', function() {\n\n    var wiredep = require('wiredep').stream;\n    var options = {\n            bowerJson: './bower.json',\n            directory: './wwwroot/lib,\n            ignorePath: 'wwwroot',\n            client: 'Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml'\n        };\n\n    return gulp\n        .src(config.index)\n        .pipe(wiredep(options))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(client));\n});\n```\n\nThe only additional npm package needed is **wiredep**, be sure to add this to the package.json.  The other file to change is the **Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml**\n\n```language-html\n    <!-- bower:css -->\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/lib/bootstrap-touch-carousel.css\">\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/lib/bootstrap.css\">\n    <!-- endbower -->\n    \n    <!-- bower:js -->\n    <script src=\"/wwwroot/lib/bootstrap-touch-carousel.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/wwwroot/lib/bootstrap.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/wwwroot/lib/hammer.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/wwwroot/lib/jquery.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/wwwroot/lib/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/lib/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js\"></script>\n    <!-- endbower -->\n\n```\n\nLook forward to your feedback!

Some developers prefer one over the other, and now that ASP.NET 5 is cross platform there may be developers using other non Visual Studio IDE and now the capability is not lost on those developers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"notes\">Notes</h3>\n\n<p>The next release of the yeoman generators, <a href=\"http://github.com/OmniSharp/generator-aspnet\">generator-aspnet</a> will contain and option to generate the <strong>web</strong> template with a gulp task runner instead of the default gulp.</p>\n\n<p><code>$ yo aspnet --gulp</code></p>\n\n<p>I would also encourage the use of the <strong>wiredep</strong> package with gulp.  This package injects the bower packages into your <em>.html</em> files by decorating them with a simple comment. Here is an example of that task.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">gulp.task('wiredep', function() {\n\n    var wiredep = require('wiredep').stream;\n    var options = {\n            bowerJson: './bower.json',\n            directory: './wwwroot/lib,\n            ignorePath: 'wwwroot',\n            client: 'Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml'\n        };\n\n    return gulp\n        .src(config.index)\n        .pipe(wiredep(options))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(client));\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The only additional npm package needed is <strong>wiredep</strong>, be sure to add this to the package.json.  The other file to change is the <strong>Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">    &lt;!-- bower:css --&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/lib/bootstrap-touch-carousel.css\"&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/lib/bootstrap.css\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- endbower --&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- bower:js --&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"/wwwroot/lib/bootstrap-touch-carousel.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"/wwwroot/lib/bootstrap.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"/wwwroot/lib/hammer.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"/wwwroot/lib/jquery.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"/wwwroot/lib/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"/lib/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;!-- endbower --&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Look forward to your feedback!
