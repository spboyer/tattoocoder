# [Ghost (0.7.0)](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) [![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/)

Want to install Ghost on Azure? Just click the 'Deploy to Azure' button and you're well on your way to have a Ghost Blog running within a minute or two. Made with :heart: for Ghost by Microsoft DX.

**Note: After deployment, Ghost will continue setup - resulting in your brand new website staying blank on the very first load. Just refresh, you'll see that everything worked well!**

#### Custom Domain
Directly after installation, Ghost will assume that your blog runs at `http://sitename.azurewebsites.net`. Should you switch to a custom domain, please inform Ghost about that change - you can do by setting the App Setting `websiteUrl` and restarting your website.
